#  MGM Casino Announces New Food Support Program for Gamblers

LAS VEGAS - MGM Casino has just announced a new food support program to help its gambling patrons. The program will allow eligible gamblers to purchase up to $500 worth of food per day at any MGM casino-owned restaurants.

MGM's decision comes as a response to the findings of a recent study that showed that a significant number of problem gamblers are also struggling with food insecurity. "We want to do everything we can to help our guests succeed in their recovery," said MGM CEO Jim Murren in a statement. "This new program is one way we can provide them with the support they need."

The program is open to all MGM casino-goers who meet certain eligibility requirements, which include being eighteen years or older and not currently participating in another MGM-sponsored gambling support program. Participants must also have a valid government ID and provide proof of income.

Eligible gamblers can use the food vouchers at any of MGM's eleven Las Vegas casinos, as well as its properties in Mississippi and Michigan. Restaurants included in the program include Emeril Lagasse's Delmonico Steakhouse, Wolfgang Puck's Cut and STACK, and Michael Mina's StripSteak.

"The Food Support Program is going to make a big difference for me," said recovering gambler Gary Wells. "I've been struggling to make ends meet, and this is going to help me get back on my feet." Wells added that he was looking forward to trying some of the restaurants he hasn't had a chance to visit yet.

MGM plans to roll out the food support program in phases, beginning on September 1st in Las Vegas and October 1st in Mississippi and Michigan. For more information or to apply for the program, visit mgmresorts.com/foodsupportprogram

#  MGM Casino Partners with Local Restaurants to Offer Food Support to Gamblers

In an effort to better serve their customers and increase their overall gaming experience, MGM Casino has announced a new program in partnership with local restaurants. Under the new program, MGM Casino patrons will have access to food support from participating restaurants.

The new program was created in response to feedback from customers who said that they would enjoy having easier access to food while they were gambling. Participating restaurants will offer special deals and discounts on food items to MGM Casino customers. In addition, the restaurants will also have representatives available at the casino so that customers can easily place orders.

MGM Casino's Vice President of Food and Beverage, Sean McBurney, commented on the new program, saying that it is designed "to provide our guests with an easy and convenient way to order their favorite foods while enjoying their time at our casino." He added that the program is also a way for MGM Casino to show its appreciation for its customers.
