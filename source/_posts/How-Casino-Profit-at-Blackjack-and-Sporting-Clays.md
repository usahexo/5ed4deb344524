#  How Casino Profit at Blackjack and Sporting Clays

Casino profit from blackjack games and sporting clays competitions may seem different, but the mathematics behind the two are actually quite similar. In both cases, the goal is to create a situation that gives the house an edge over the player.

In blackjack, the casino can achieve this by dealing out more conservative hands to players. For sporting clays, the casino can make it more difficult for shooters to hit their targets by placing obstacles in their way.

Both blackjack and sporting clays offer the house a small advantage that can add up over time. This is why casino profits from these activities are so significant.

In addition, Reno offers several casinos with sporting clay facilities, including Grand Sierra Resort and Casino, Peppermill Reno Casino Spa Resort, and Boomtown Reno Hotel Casino.

#  Playing Blackjack and Sporting Clays for Profit

In the casino game of blackjack, the house edge is about 0.5 percent. In sporting clays, it can be more than double that. So if you are looking to make a profit playing games of chance, blackjack is the better option.

That said, there is still money to be made playing sporting clays. The key is to find competitions with low entry fees and respectable payouts. For example, a recent tournament in my area offered a $500 first prize and only cost $50 to enter. With a 10 percent payout, that’s a potential return of $10 on your investment.

Of course, you’ll need to be reasonably good at sporting clays to have any chance of winning these tournaments. But even if you don’t take home the top prize, there’s still a good chance of breaking even or making a small profit.

So if you are looking for a fun (and potentially profitable) way to spend an afternoon or weekend, give blackjack or sporting clays a try!
