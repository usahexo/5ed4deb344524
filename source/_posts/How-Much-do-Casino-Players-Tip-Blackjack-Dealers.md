#  The Definitive Guide to Tipping for Blackjack

 slot of casino games come with a built-in house edge, but blackjack is not one of them. In fact, if you play perfect blackjack strategy, your odds of winning are very close to even. That's why blackjack is one of the most popular casino games – it offers gamblers a fair chance at winning real money.

One thing that can tilt the odds in your favor though, is using the right strategy when it comes to tipping the dealer. In this article, we're going to go over the basics of tipping for blackjack, as well as some specific scenarios where it might be advantageous to do so.

When it comes to tipping the dealer, there are no hard and fast rules; it's ultimately up to you how much you want to give. However, a good rule of thumb is to tip between 10 and 20 percent of your total winnings for the hand. So if you win $100 on a hand, you would tip between $10 and $20.

There are two main reasons why you might want to tip the dealer: to show your appreciation for a job well done, and to gain an edge in future hands. Let's take a look at each scenario in more detail.

If you're happy with the dealer's performance – for example, they didn't make any mistakes and dealt cards quickly and efficiently – then a small token of appreciation is in order. A $1 or $2 tip is generally enough; anything more than that may seem excessive.

However, if you feel that the dealer made mistakes that cost you money – for example, they didn't give you back your bet when they should have, or they dealt out an extra card when they shouldn't have – then tipping them can help offset those errors somewhat. Tipping 10 percent of your winnings for the hand can help make up for these kind of mistakes, and can help ensure that you get fair treatment from the dealer in future hands.

Of course, whether or not you decide to tip the dealer is ultimately up to you; there's no guarantee that tipping will give you an edge in future hands. But if you're looking for a way to increase your chances of winning at blackjack, tipping the dealer could be a good strategy to try out.

#  How much should you really tip your blackjack dealer?

Most people would agree that when it comes to gratuity, servers and service industry workers should be the ones who receive the bulk of the generosity. After all, they are the ones who are providing a personal service and often go above and beyond to ensure customer satisfaction. But what about blackjack dealers? How much should you really tip them?

The answer to this question is not as clear-cut as with other service workers. For one, blackjack dealers are not always tipped, even though they arguably provide a valuable service. And if they are tipped, the amount can vary significantly depending on the casino, the location within the casino, and even the dealer's personality.

In general, however, most experts agree that tipping blackjack dealers is not necessary, but is certainly appreciated. And if you do decide to tip your dealer, anywhere from $1 to $5 per hand is generally considered appropriate.
