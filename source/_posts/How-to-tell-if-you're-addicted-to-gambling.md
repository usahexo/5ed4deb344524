#  5 signs you're addicted to gambling

Problem gambling is a real issue, and it often goes undetected because people tend to downplay its seriousness. It can be hard to admit that you have a problem, but if you recognize any of the following signs in yourself, it might be time to seek help.

1. You can't resist the urge to gamble

If you find yourself constantly thinking about gambling and feeling an uncontrollable urge to play, then you're likely addicted. Gambling isn't something that should be taken lightly - it can quickly consume your life and lead to financial ruin.

2. You gamble even when you can't afford to

One of the hallmarks of addiction is compulsive behaviour, and this often includes gambling even when you can't afford it. If you're resorting to gambling as a way to cope with financial problems or other stressors in your life, then it's a sign that you need help.

3. You've lost significant amounts of money gambling

If you've hit a rough patch financially as a result of your gambling addiction, then you're not alone. Gambling can be extremely costly, and those who are addicted often end up losing large sums of money. This can lead to serious financial problems and even bankruptcy.

4. You hide your gambling from others

If you're ashamed of your gambling habit or trying to keep it a secret from family and friends, then that's another sign that you may have a problem. Denial is common among people with addiction issues, but it's important to get help before things spiral out of control.

5. Gambling becomes your only priority

When gambling starts taking precedence over other things in your life - such as work, school or relationships - then it's definitely become a problem. If gambling is all you think about and all you want to do, then it's time to get some help.

#  Do you have a gambling problem? Here's how to find out

Gambling has been around for centuries, and while it can be fun and exciting, it can also be addictive and damaging. If you're worried that you or someone you know might have a gambling problem, here are some signs to look out for.

1. You gamble more than you can afford to lose.

This is the most obvious sign of a gambling addiction. If you find yourself constantly gambling larger and larger sums of money, even when you can't really afford to, then you may have a problem.

If gambling is causing tension with your loved ones or impacting your job performance, then it's definitely time to address the issue.

3. You feel the need to gamble constantly.

Do you find yourself thinking about gambling all the time? Do you feel like you can't relax or have fun unless you're betting on something? This is another sign of an addiction.

4. You've lied to hide your gambling behavior.

Lying about your gambling habits is a classic sign of addiction. If you're not ready to admit that you have a problem, then there's definitely something wrong.

5. You've experienced financial difficulties as a result of gambling.

If you've lost money because of your gambling habit, then that's definitely a cause for concern. Gambling can quickly drain your bank account and cause serious financial problems down the road.
