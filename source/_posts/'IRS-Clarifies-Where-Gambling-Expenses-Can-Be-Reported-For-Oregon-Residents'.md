#  'IRS Clarifies Where Gambling Expenses Can Be Reported For Oregon Residents'

Oregon residents who gamble now have some clarification from the IRS about where they should report their gambling winnings and expenses. The new IRS guidelines state that Oregon residents should report all gambling income and losses on their federal tax return, regardless of whether the gambling took place in Oregon or another state.

The new guidelines are in response to Oregon's recent legalization of casino-style gambling. Oregon is one of several states that have recently legalized various forms of gambling, as the popularity of casino gaming grows nationwide.

The new IRS guidelines apply to all Oregon residents, not just those who gamble. So, for example, if you made a trip to Las Vegas and won $1,000 playing blackjack, you would report that income on your federal tax return. Likewise, if you lost $500 playing poker, you would deduct that amount from your income on your return.

The IRS has issued guidance on how to report gambling income and losses in other states as well. For example, if you live in a state that has legalized online gambling, you would report your online gambling income and losses on your federal return. If you live in a state with no legal restrictions on gambling, you would still report all your gambling income and losses on your federal return.

The purpose of the new IRS guidelines is to make sure that all Oregon residents are reporting their gambling income and expenses in a consistent manner. Gambling income and expenses can be complex to track and report, so these new guidelines should help taxpayers stay in compliance with the law.

#  'IRS Issues Guidance On Gambling Expenses Reporting In Oregon'

On Tuesday, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) released guidance on how to report gambling expenses incurred by individuals living in Oregon. The new guidance implements section 184 of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which allows taxpayers to deduct gambling losses up to the amount of their winnings.

The guidance document defines gambling as "the placing of bets or wagers on any game or contest of chance at any time." It further specifies that only net losses from gambling activities may be deducted, and that losses must be itemized separately from other Miscellaneous Itemized Deductions on Schedule A.

Gambling income is also subject to income tax, and must be reported on Form 1040, line 21. The IRS advises taxpayers to keep accurate records of their gambling activity, including winnings and losses, in order to support any deductions taken.

Oregon is one of 18 states that currently allow gambling losses to be deducted from taxable income. Other states with similar provisions include California, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

#  'Oregon Residents Can Now Claim Gambling Losses On Their Federal Tax Returns'

Oregon residents can now claim gambling losses on their federal tax returns. The state's Department of Revenue announced the change on Feb. 1, 2018.

Residents had been asking for the change for years, according to Department of Revenue spokesman Bob Estabrook. "There was a lot of discussion about it," he said. "It's something people wanted."

The new rules apply to all types of gambling, including casino games, horse racing, and online poker. To qualify, taxpayers must keep track of their winnings and losses throughout the year. Gambling income is still taxable, and taxpayers must report both wins and losses on their federal tax returns.

The change is expected to benefit Oregon taxpayers by about $3 million per year.

#  'Are You Ready To File Your Oregon Taxes? Make Sure To Include Gambling Losses!'

As the 2017 tax season rapidly approaches, many Oregonians are starting to get their paperwork in order. This includes gathering W-2s and 1099s, as well as calculating their taxable income.

For those who enjoy gambling, there is another important task to take care of before filing your taxes: tallying up your gambling losses.

Oregon allows taxpayers to deduct their net gambling losses from their taxable income, up to the amount of their winnings. So, if you had $1,000 in gambling winnings last year but also suffered $1,200 in gambling losses, you can only claim a $200 deduction on your tax return.

Keep in mind that you can only claim gambling losses if you itemize your deductions on Form 1040 Schedule A. If you choose the standard deduction instead, you cannot claim any losses from gambling or any other type of wagering activity.

There are a few other things to keep in mind when claiming gambling losses:

- Gambling losses include not just money lost at casinos, but also money lost at racetracks, card clubs, and other betting activities.

- Gambling losses must be reported as "Other Miscellaneous Losses" on Schedule A.

- You cannot claim a deduction for gambling losses if they are related to illegal activities.

#  'Gambling Expenses Now Legitimate Tax Deductions In Oregon'

Oregonians were recently thrilled to hear that their state government has deemed gambling expenses as tax-deductible. This means that any Oregonian who gambles can now legitimately write off those expenses on their taxes.

Governor Kate Brown made the announcement earlier this month, and it was met with a great deal of enthusiasm by the people of Oregon. According to Governor Brown, "this change is about giving Oregonians the opportunity to do what's best for their families."

Many people are already planning to take advantage of this new rule. Debbie Winters, a Salem resident, says that she's looking forward to being able to deduct her gambling losses from her taxable income. "This is great news," she said. "I'm going to be able to save a lot of money on my taxes this year."

Not everyone is as enthusiastic about the new rule, however. Some Oregonians worry that it will encourage gambling addiction and irresponsible spending. But Governor Brown is confident that the new rule will have a positive effect overall. "The vast majority of Oregonians who gamble do so responsibly," she said. "This change simply gives them the opportunity to offset any losses they may incur."

Whatever people's opinions might be, one thing is for sure: gambling expenses are now legitimate tax deductions in Oregon. So if you're an Oregonian who likes to gamble, be sure to take advantage of this new rule!
