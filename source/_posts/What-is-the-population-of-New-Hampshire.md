#  Who are the current champions of Serie A?

The current champions of Serie A are Juventus. The Turin-based side won their 35th title last season, and they will be looking to make it 36 this year. Juventus have been the dominant force in Italian football over the past few years, and they look set to continue their dominance this season.

However, they will face some tough competition from teams such as Napoli, AS Roma and Inter Milan. These teams will all be looking to dethrone Juventus and win their first Serie A title.

It should be an exciting season in Serie A, with plenty of competition for the top spot. Juventus are the favourites to win the title again, but they will not find it easy against some very strong opposition.

The season runs from August to May and each team plays 34 matches. At the end of the season, the top four teams qualify for the UEFA Champions League, while the fifth-placed team goes into the UEFA Europa League. The bottom three teams are relegated to Serie B, while the team that finishes in 17th place faces a playoff against one from Serie B to try and avoid relegation.
