#  What Is the Legitimate Gambling Age in New Hampshire?

The legal gambling age in New Hampshire is 21 years old. This applies to all forms of gambling, including casinos, lotteries, and racetracks.

While the law is clear on the minimum age for gambling, there is no specific law that prohibits minors from participating in gambling activities. However, minors are not allowed to gamble at casinos or other licensed venues.

Parents and guardians are responsible for ensuring their children do not gamble before they reach the legal age. Penalties for violating the gambling age law include fines and/or imprisonment.

If you have any questions about the legal gambling age in New Hampshire, contact an attorney or the state gaming commission.

#  What Is the Legitimate Gambling Age in Nevada?

Though there is no federally mandated gambling age, individual states are allowed to set their own age requirements. In Nevada, the legal gambling age is 21. This applies to all forms of gambling, including casino games, lotteries, and sports betting.

There are some exceptions to this rule. You may gamble at the age of 18 if you are playing in a bingo or keno game in a licensed social club. And you can also gamble at the age of 18 in a tribal casino that is on tribal land.

There are some arguments for raising the gambling age in Nevada. One point that is often made is that casinos have become so ubiquitous, it is now harder for young people to avoid exposure to gambling. It is argued that by raising the age limit, casinos would have less exposure to underage gamblers, and this would help protect vulnerable young people from developing a gambling addiction.

Others argue against raising the gambling age, arguing that it would only drive underage gambling underground, where it would be harder to monitor and regulate. They also argue that most young people who gamble do so responsibly, and that any problems associated with underage gambling are better dealt with through education and prevention programs rather than by increasing the legal age limit.

#  What Is the Legitimate Gambling Age in Ohio?

Ohio's legal gambling age is 21. This is the same as the legal drinking age in the state.

There are several forms of legal gambling in Ohio, including casino gambling, racetrack betting, and lottery tickets. In order to participate in any of these activities, you must be at least 21 years old.

There are a few exceptions to the legal gambling age. For example, you can place bets on horse races when you are 18 years old. And you can play the lottery if you are at least 18 years old.

The legal gambling age in Ohio is set by state law. There is no federal law that sets a specific age limit for gambling. Each state determines its own legal gambling age.

If you're not sure what the legal gambling age is in your state, check with your local authorities.

#  What Is the Legitimate Gambling Age in Oklahoma?

Oklahoma has a legal gambling age of 18. This means that anyone 18 or older can gamble in the state. This includes playing casino games, betting on horse races, and playing lottery games.

There are some exceptions to this rule. People under the age of 18 can still gamble in Indian casinos if they are accompanied by an adult. There are also some pari-mutuel facilities that allow people as young as 17 to bet on horses.

The legal gambling age in Oklahoma is one of the lowest in the country. Only a handful of states have a lower gambling age than Oklahoma.

why is oklahoma's gambling age so low?

There is no one answer to this question. However, there are a few potential reasons why Oklahoma has such a low gambling age.

One possibility is that Oklahoma sees gambling as a relatively harmless activity. Unlike alcohol or drugs, there is no scientific evidence that suggests that gambling can be addictive or harmful to your health. In fact, some research suggests that moderate levels of gambling can be beneficial to your mental health.

Another possibility is that Oklahoma lawmakers see gambling as a way to bring revenue into the state. Gambling generates billions of dollars in revenue every year, and Oklahoma could stand to benefit from those profits.

Finally, it's possible that lawmakers simply don't see any harm in allowing people aged 18 and older to gamble. There is no evidence that younger gamblers are more likely to experience negative consequences than older gamblers. So, there may not be much reason to restrict access to casinos and other gambling venues based on age alone.

#  What Is the Legitimate Gambling Age in Oregon?

Oregon has two gambling age laws - one for casinos and one for tribal casinos. For state-licensed casinos, the minimum gambling age is 21. However, for tribal casinos, the minimum age is 18. The discrepancy between the ages for casinos is due to a federal law that gives tribes the right to self-governance on certain matters, including gambling.

The tribal casino gambling age of 18 has been in effect since 1990, when Congress passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA). The IGRA allows tribes to offer certain types of casino games, as long as the state in which the tribe is located permits casino gaming. In Oregon, both state-licensed and tribal casinos are allowed to offer slot machines, blackjack, craps, and other table games.

Some people have argued that the 18-year-old tribal gambling age should be raised to match the 21-year-old state gambling age. However, others contend that it's not appropriate to enforce state laws on tribal lands. They argue that the tribes should be able to set their own gambling ages, just as they can set their own laws regarding other matters such as taxation and environmental regulation.

So far, there has been no move by Congress or the tribes themselves to change the minimum gambling age in Oregon.
