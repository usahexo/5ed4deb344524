#  Watch Out For The Wild In Hockey League Play

For the avid hockey fan, watching their favorite players skate around the rink and make daring plays is always a thrilling experience. And for fans of teams with particularly aggressive players, there’s always the excitement of watching them take on opponents in close physical encounters. But as thrilling as these moments can be, they can also result in injuries.

There’s no question that hockey is a physical sport, and when two teams of highly competitive players go head-to-head, things can get heated. Throw in some physical contact along the boards or in the corners and you often see skirmishes break out. While it may be entertaining for fans to watch, these altercations can also lead to dangerous situations on the ice.

Players skating at full speed towards each other in an effort to win a puck battle can end up colliding and crashing into the boards or each other. This can easily result in a player being thrown violently into the ice, potentially causing a serious injury. In addition, when two players start exchanging punches while others are trying to break it up, there’s always the risk of someone getting hurt by flying fists.

So if you’re a fan of physical hockey play, be sure to keep an eye out for potential injuries. And if you find yourself caught up in the excitement of a scrum or donnybrook, remember that everyone involved is trying to win – so try not to get too carried away!

#  Minnesota Team Goes Wild In Victory Over Rivals

The Minnesota Vikings beat their rivals, the Green Bay Packers, Sunday night in a stunning victory. This was a much-needed win for the Vikings, who are now in first place in the NFC North division.

Minnesota got off to a quick start, scoring a touchdown on their opening drive. The Packers responded with a touchdown of their own later in the first quarter, but the Vikings scored again before halftime to take a 14-7 lead into the break.

Green Bay came back to tie the game in the third quarter, but Minnesota scored two more touchdowns in the fourth to take control of the game. The Packers pulled within seven points late in the fourth, but could not score again.

The Vikings defense played well all night, intercepting Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers twice. Cornerback Xavier Rhodes had an especially big night, intercepting Rodgers once and knocking down several passes.

Running back Dalvin Cook also had a big game for Minnesota, rushing for 97 yards and two touchdowns.

With this win, the Vikings are now in first place in the NFC North division with a 5-2 record. They will next face the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday afternoon.

#  Edmonton Oilers vs Minnesota Wild: NHL Western Conference Playoff Preview

The Edmonton Oilers and Minnesota Wild will face off in the NHL Western Conference Playoff semifinals starting April 26. The Wild finished the regular season with a 46-29-7 record, good for 99 points and the third seed in the Western Conference. The Oilers finished the regular season with a 47-26-9 record, good for 103 points and the second seed in the Western Conference.

Edmonton won three out of four games against Minnesota during the regular season. The Wild’s lone victory over Edmonton came on January 14, when they defeated the Oilers 4-2. Edmonton scored nine goals over the four games against Minnesota, while allowing six.

Minnesota will have home ice advantage in the best-of-seven series. They are 2-2 at home in their previous four games against Edmonton this season.
In their last meeting on April 9, Edmonton won 5-3 behind two goals from Connor McDavid. Leon Draisaitl and Patrick Maroon also scored for the Oilers in that game. Ryan Nugent-Hopkins had three assists in that game, giving him 11 assists over his last 10 games played.

The Wild will likely have Erik Haula back for this series after he missed the last six games of the regular season with an injury. Without Haula, Mikko Koivu centered Zach Parise and Jason Pominville on Minnesota’s top line. Koivu finished fourth on the team with 55 points (18 goals, 37 assists) in 78 games this season. Parise led Minnesota with 34 goals this season and had 69 points (34 goals, 35 assists) in 82 games this season. Pominville tallied 58 points (20 goals, 38 assists) in 78 games this season.

Edmonton’s lineup is expected to be unchanged from their first round series against San Jose Sharks other than Cam Talbot getting start instead of Jonas Gustavsson who started Games 1 and 2 against San Jose. Talbot played well against San Jose, posting a 2-1 record with a 2.03 GAA and a .925 save percentage; he was named one of the three stars of each game he played during that series..

Ryan Strome had five points (two goals, three assists) against San Jose and will likely remain on Connor McDavid’s left wing going into this series against Minnesota.. With Jordan Eberle out due to injury, Drake Caggiula has filled in nicely on McDavid’s right wing; he had two goals and two assists against San Jose.. Milan Lucic has continued his strong play from late in the regular season into these playoffs; he has two goals and two assists so far this postseason..

One area where Edmonton may have an advantage over Minnesota is on defense; Oscar Klefbom averaged 24:36 minutes per game during the regular season while Ryan Suter averaged 28:32 minutes per game for Minnesota.. Klefbom is also coming off a strong series against San Jose where he recorded four points (two goals, two assists). With Brent Burns leading all playoff skaters with 12 points (five goals, seven assists), it will be important for Klefbom to continue to play well if Edmonton wants to advance to their first Stanley Cup Finals since 2006..

#  NHL Playoffs: Edmonton Oilers v Minnesota Wild

The Oilers finished the regular season in 2nd place in the Pacific Division, while the Wild were 4th in the Central Division. This will be the 3rd time these teams have met in the playoffs, with the Oilers winning both of the previous encounters.

In their latest matchup on March 14th, Edmonton won by a score of 4-2. Connor McDavid had a goal and two assists for the Oilers, while Mikko Koivu led Minnesota with a goal and an assist. Edmonton goaltender Cam Talbot made 36 saves in the victory.

Talbot will likely start in goal again for Edmonton in this series, while Devan Dubnyk is expected to get the nod for Minnesota.

Dubnyk had an excellent season for Minnesota, finishing 5th in the NHL in save percentage (.923) and 8th in goals against average (2.37). However, he was pulled from Game 2 of their opening round series against St. Louis after allowing four goals on just 17 shots faced. Darcy Kuemper started Game 3 and fared no better, allowing five goals on 28 shots as Minnesota lost by a score of 7-4.

Minnesota will need Dubnyk to be at his best if they hope to beat Edmonton, as McDavid and Leon Draisaitl form one of the most deadly tandems in the NHL. Draisaitl finished 3rd in league scoring this season with 100 points (41 goals, 59 assists), while McDavid led the NHL with 108 points (41 goals, 67 assists).

Edmonton also has other dangerous offensive players such as Ryan Nugent-Hopkins (76 points), Jesse Puljujarvi (44 points), and Patrick Maroon (43 points).

On defense, Oscar Klefbom and Adam Larsson are a formidable duo. Klefbom had 39 points this season (13 goals, 26 assists) while Larsson added 22 points (two goals, 20 assists).

The Wild’s top defensive pairing is Jonas Brodin and Matt Dumba. Brodin had 32 points this year (six goals, 26 assists) while Dumba registered 43 points (20 goals, 23 assists). However, both players struggled defensively against St. Louis in the opening round series.

Overall, I believe that Edmonton is the better team and should win this series fairly easily. They have more firepower offensively and are better defensively than Minnesota.
