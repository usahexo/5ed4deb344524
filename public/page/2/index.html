The event took place at the Casino Admiral in Prague and was hosted by Regency Casinos.</p>

<p>The semifinals consisted of two heads-up matches, which saw Michal Macko and Petr Kareš take their places in the final. In the end, it was Macko who came out on top, taking home the title and €5,000 in prize money. Kareš settled for second place and €3,000 in prize money.</p>

<h1 id="Isn’t-it-Time-You-Took-Your-Chance-at-Czech-Blackjack"><a href="#Isn’t-it-Time-You-Took-Your-Chance-at-Czech-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Isn’t it Time You Took Your Chance at Czech Blackjack?"></a>Isn’t it Time You Took Your Chance at Czech Blackjack?</h1><p>Czech blackjack is a great opportunity to make some money. The game is based on the same rules as traditional blackjack, with a few slight differences that can make all the difference. If you’re looking for an exciting and profitable game to try your hand at, Czech blackjack is definitely worth considering.</p>
<p>The first difference between traditional blackjack and Czech blackjack is that in the latter, players are not allowed to double down on any two cards. This eliminates one of the most risky moves in blackjack and makes the game a little more conservative. However, it also opens up new opportunities for skilled players who can take advantage of other aspects of the game.</p>
<p>Another difference between the two versions is that players are allowed to split pairs up to three times, giving them more chances to form winning hands. Additionally, players are also allowed to re-split pairs if they draw another card of the same rank, which can lead to some very big payouts if everything falls into place.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for an interesting and lucrative variation on traditional blackjack, give Czech blackjack a try. It may take a little getting used to but it’s well worth it in the long run!</p>
<h1 id="Surrender-your-Chance-at-Victory-with-Czech-Blackjack"><a href="#Surrender-your-Chance-at-Victory-with-Czech-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Surrender your Chance at Victory with Czech Blackjack"></a>Surrender your Chance at Victory with Czech Blackjack</h1><p>If you are looking for an interesting blackjack game to play, you may want to try Czech Blackjack. This game offers some unique twists on the classic game that can give you a better chance at victory. However, you may also find that surrendering your chance at victory can be a more lucrative option.</p>
<p>In traditional blackjack, the goal is to draw cards until you reach 21 points or come as close as possible without going over. If the dealer has more points than you, you lose. In Czech Blackjack, there are a few differences that can impact the outcome of the game.</p>
<p>First, players are given three cards instead of two. The third card is always placed face up and reveals the dealer’s point total. If the player’s total is higher than the dealer’s total with two cards, they win just as in traditional blackjack. However, if the player’s total is lower than the dealer’s total with two cards, they still have the opportunity to win by drawing another card.</p>
<p>If the player chooses to take another card and their total equals or beats the dealer’s total with three cards, they automatically win. If the player busts (goes over 21), they automatically lose regardless of what the dealer has. Another difference is that players can choose to surrender instead of drawing another card.</p>
<p>When you surrender in Czech Blackjack, you forfeit half your bet and give up your chance at winning the hand. However, this can be a more lucrative option than drawing another card if you think that your chances of winning are slim. For instance, if you have a hand totaling 12 and the dealer has a 6 showing, surrendering would be a better option than drawing another card since your odds of winning are only 33%.</p>
<p>While Czech Blackjack offers some interesting twists on the classic game, it is important to remember that strategy still plays a big role in whether or not you win. Be sure to familiarize yourself with all of the rules before playing so that you can make sound decisions while betting.</p>

<h1 id="How-Safe-Are-Gambling-Sites-In-The-UK"><a href="#How-Safe-Are-Gambling-Sites-In-The-UK" class="headerlink" title="How Safe Are Gambling Sites In The UK?"></a>How Safe Are Gambling Sites In The UK?</h1><p>The online gambling industry has exploded in the UK over the last few years, with a broad range of sites now offering betting and gaming options to consumers. But how safe are these sites, and how does the UK gambling landscape compare to other countries?</p>
<p>One of the biggest issues affecting online gambling safety is whether or not the site is properly licensed. In the UK, all gambling sites must be licensed by the Gambling Commission in order to offer services to British citizens. This means that any site found to be operating without a license will be shut down, and players’ funds may not be protected in the event that the site goes bankrupt.</p>
<p>Since its inception in 2004, the Gambling Commission has only revoked five licenses, meaning that the vast majority of licensed gambling sites are safe to use. However, it is always important to do your own research before signing up with any site, as there have been cases of unscrupulous operators running rogue operations.</p>
<p>In addition to licensing, another key factor in determining safety is whether or not a site employs secure payment methods. Most reputable sites use SSL encryption technology to protect players’ financial information, meaning that it cannot be intercepted by third parties. This ensures that your details are safe when you deposit or withdraw money from your account.</p>
<p>When it comes to comparing casino safety between different countries, it’s hard to say definitively which one is best. The UK does have some of the most stringent regulations in place, but this doesn’t mean that other countries don’t have their own measures in place to protect players. That said, the UK market is certainly well regulated, meaning that you can be confident that your funds are safe when playing at a British site.</p>
<h1 id="Which-Gambling-Sites-Are-The-Best-In-The-UK"><a href="#Which-Gambling-Sites-Are-The-Best-In-The-UK" class="headerlink" title="Which Gambling Sites Are The Best In The UK?"></a>Which Gambling Sites Are The Best In The UK?</h1><p>The gambling industry is huge in the UK, with people spending billions of pounds every year on traditional betting activities such as horse racing and football matches, as well as casino games and online slots. With so much money on the line, it’s important to know which gambling sites are the best in the UK.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll take a look at some of the most reputable and popular gambling sites in the UK. We’ll also discuss what makes these sites special, and why you should consider signing up for an account.</p>

<h1 id="How-Do-I-Choose-The-Right-Gambling-Site-In-The-UK"><a href="#How-Do-I-Choose-The-Right-Gambling-Site-In-The-UK" class="headerlink" title="How Do I Choose The Right Gambling Site In The UK?"></a>How Do I Choose The Right Gambling Site In The UK?</h1><p>There are seemingly limitless gambling sites to choose from when you’re living in the United Kingdom. How do you know which one is best for you and your unique gambling needs?</p>
<p>Below we breakdown some of the key factors you should consider when choosing a site, as well as some of our top recommendations.</p>
<p>Licensing and Regulations</p>
<p>One of the most important considerations when choosing a gambling site is its licensing and regulatory status. Only choose sites that have a license from a reputable governing body such as the UK Gambling Commission. This will ensure that your funds are safe and that the site is honest and reliable.</p>
<p>Game Selection</p>
<p>Another important factor to consider is the game selection on offer at each site. Different sites offer different games, so be sure to compare and contrast the offerings before making your decision. If you’re looking for a specific game, it’s important to find a site that offers it. Otherwise, you may be disappointed with your selection.</p>
<p>Welcome Bonuses and Promotions</p>
<p>Almost all gambling sites offer welcome bonuses and promotions to new players. Be sure to compare the offers between different sites to find the best deal for you. Often, the bigger bonuses come with stricter terms and conditions, so be sure to read them thoroughly before signing up.</p>
<p>Banking Options</p>
<p>When choosing a gambling site, it’s important to consider the banking options available. All of the major debit and credit cards are usually accepted, as well as a variety of e-wallets such as PayPal and Skrill. Be sure to check which methods are available at each site before signing up.</p>
<p>Customer Support</p>
<p>Finally, be sure to consider the quality of customer support offered by each site. If you have any questions or problems while playing, it’s important to have access to reliable and helpful customer support staff. Look for sites with 24/7 live chat support, telephone support, and email support so that you can get help whenever you need it.</p>
<h1 id="Is-Gambling-Online-Legal-In-The-UK"><a href="#Is-Gambling-Online-Legal-In-The-UK" class="headerlink" title="Is Gambling Online Legal In The UK?"></a>Is Gambling Online Legal In The UK?</h1><p>The legality of gambling online in the UK is a somewhat murky topic. There are no specific laws that make gambling online illegal in the UK, but there are a number of laws that could be used to prosecute individuals who engage in this activity.</p>
<p>One such law is the Gambling Act 2005, which prohibits gambling activities that are not licensed by the Gambling Commission. This means that any unlicensed gambling websites or activities could be considered illegal. However, the act does not specifically mention online gambling, so it is unclear whether this activity would fall under its scope.</p>
<p>Another relevant law is the Computer Misuse Act 1990, which makes it an offence to access a computer without authority with the intention of committing or facilitating a criminal offence. This law could be used to prosecute people who use unlicensed online gambling sites, as they would be accessing these sites without authority.</p>
<p>Despite these potential legal implications, online gambling is relatively widespread in the UK. This may be because there have been no prosecutions of individuals for using unlicensed websites and because there is some ambiguity surrounding the legality of online gambling. Ultimately, it is up to individual users to decide whether they want to take the risk of using unlicensed sites, given the potential legal consequences.</p>

        <h1 id="Gambling-industry-fuelling-Nevada’s-economic-growth"><a href="#Gambling-industry-fuelling-Nevada’s-economic-growth" class="headerlink" title="Gambling industry fuelling Nevada’s economic growth"></a>Gambling industry fuelling Nevada’s economic growth</h1><p>The gambling industry is one of the biggest contributors to Nevada’s economic growth. Casinos and resorts in the state generate more than $10 billion in revenue every year, accounting for almost a third of the state’s GDP. This makes gambling one of Nevada’s most important industries, and it’s responsible for creating tens of thousands of jobs in the state.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for Nevada’s strong gambling industry. The first is that the state has long been a haven for gamblers. It was one of the first states to legalize casino gambling, and it has always had a relaxed attitude towards gambling. This has attracted tourists from all over the world, and it has helped make Las Vegas one of the most famous tourist destinations in the world.</p>
<p>The second reason is that Nevada has a lot of casinos. There are more than 150 casinos in the state, and they’re spread out across its vast desert landscape. This means that there is something to appeal to everyone, whether you’re looking for a high-end resort or a more down-to-earth gaming hall.</p>
<p>Finally, Nevada has been very successful in marketing itself as a gambling destination. The state has spent billions of dollars on advertising and marketing, and it has built an impressive infrastructure of casinos and resorts. This means that visitors can easily find what they’re looking for, and they know that they’re guaranteed a good time when they visit Nevada.</p>
<p>The gambling industry is critical to Nevada’s economy, and it looks like it will continue to grow in the years ahead. Thanks to its favorable climate and well-funded marketing efforts, Nevada is poised to remain the top gambling destination in the world.</p>
<h1 id="Slot-machines-account-for-bulk-of-Nevada-casinos’-revenue"><a href="#Slot-machines-account-for-bulk-of-Nevada-casinos’-revenue" class="headerlink" title="Slot machines account for bulk of Nevada casinos’ revenue"></a>Slot machines account for bulk of Nevada casinos’ revenue</h1><p>Slot machines account for more than 70 percent of Nevada casinos’ total revenue, according to the state’s Gaming Control Board. In Clark County, home to the city of Las Vegas, slots generate more than $9 billion in revenue every year. </p>
<p>The popularity of slots is due in part to their low house edge. Most slot machines offer a return of between 85 and 95 percent, compared to just 50 percent for blackjack. This means players have a better chance of walking away with some money in their pockets when playing slots. </p>
<p>Another reason slots are so popular is that they are relatively easy to play. Players simply need to insert cash or a casino chip into the machine, select the amount they want to bet, and hit the spin button. There is no complicated strategy to learn and no need to keep track of cards. </p>
<p>Slot machines can be found in almost every casino in Nevada. Some casinos have literally hundreds of them on their floors, which can make it difficult for players looking for other games to find a spot. For this reason, many casinos now include table games like blackjack and craps as well as slots in their gaming areas. </p>
<p>But despite the proliferation of table games, slots remain one of the most popular forms of gambling in Nevada. And with good reason – they offer players a chance to win big payouts while requiring very little skill or knowledge.</p>

<p>The study by the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, also said that gambling provides $1.4 billion in tax revenue each year to state and local governments. That’s about 9% of the state budget.</p>
<p>Most of the revenue _ $1.2 billion _ comes from jobs associated with casinos and hotels, while the rest comes from industries such as manufacturing and construction that support the casino industry.</p>
<p>The study also said that for every job in gambling there are 1.3 jobs in other sectors of the economy that benefit from gambling, such as restaurants and retail stores.</p>
<p>“Gambling is a very important part of our economy and has been for many years,” said Jennifer Roberts, research director at the center and an author of the report. “This report underscores just how important it is to Nevada.”</p>
<p>Roberts said she was surprised at how much tax revenue gambling generates for state and local governments. She said it underscores the need to diversify the state’s economy so it’s not so dependent on gambling.</p>
<p>Nevada has been hit hard by the recession, with unemployment running well above the national average. The state has lost tens of thousands of jobs in construction and other sectors that have been hurt by the housing slump.</p>
<h1 id="Economic-contribution-of-gambling-industry-in-Nevada-most-notable-in-rural-areas"><a href="#Economic-contribution-of-gambling-industry-in-Nevada-most-notable-in-rural-areas" class="headerlink" title="Economic contribution of gambling industry in Nevada most notable in rural areas"></a>Economic contribution of gambling industry in Nevada most notable in rural areas</h1><p>The gambling industry in Nevada is a significant economic contributor, particularly in rural areas. According to the Nevada Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation, the gambling industry accounted for more than $9.5 billion in total economic output in 2016, including $7.2 billion in wages and salaries.</p>
<p>Rural counties have particularly benefited from the gambling industry. In Churchill County, for example, the gambling industry accounted for more than one-quarter of all economic output in 2016. Washoe County—home to Reno and Sparks—is the state’s largest county, but the gambling industry still accounted for almost 10 percent of all economic output there. And in Elko County, which is home to several casinos and gaming operations, the gambling industry accounts for more than one-third of all economic output.</p>
<p>These figures underscore the importance of the gambling industry to rural Nevada economies. The jobs and wages that the gambling industry supports are critical to these communities’ overall economic health.</p>
<h1 id="Study-finds-gambling-industry-has-significant-positive-effect-on-Nevadan-economy"><a href="#Study-finds-gambling-industry-has-significant-positive-effect-on-Nevadan-economy" class="headerlink" title="Study finds gambling industry has significant positive effect on Nevadan economy"></a>Study finds gambling industry has significant positive effect on Nevadan economy</h1><p>The gambling industry in Nevada is a major contributor to the state economy, according to a study released Wednesday by UNLV.</p>
<p>The study found that the gambling industry has a significant positive effect on employment, wages and other economic indicators in the state.</p>
<p>In total, the gambling industry accounted for $11.5 billion in economic output in 2015, or about 15 percent of Nevada’s GDP. The industry supported nearly 122,000 jobs and generated more than $2.3 billion in wages and salaries.</p>
<p>“This study confirms what we have long known - that the gaming and hospitality industries are vital drivers of our economy,” said Gov. Brian Sandoval in a statement. “They provide quality jobs and generate billions of dollars in revenue each year.”</p>
<p>Gaming revenue accounts for more than two-thirds of all revenue generated by legal gambling nationwide, according to the American Gaming Association. In Nevada, gaming revenue accounts for more than 90 percent of total gambling revenue.</p>
<p>The UNLV study was conducted with funding from the Gaming Control Board and the World Gaming Summit &amp; Expo.</p>

And for fans of teams with particularly aggressive players, there’s always the excitement of watching them take on opponents in close physical encounters. But as thrilling as these moments can be, they can also result in injuries.</p>
<p>There’s no question that hockey is a physical sport, and when two teams of highly competitive players go head-to-head, things can get heated. Throw in some physical contact along the boards or in the corners and you often see skirmishes break out. While it may be entertaining for fans to watch, these altercations can also lead to dangerous situations on the ice.</p>
<p>Players skating at full speed towards each other in an effort to win a puck battle can end up colliding and crashing into the boards or each other. This can easily result in a player being thrown violently into the ice, potentially causing a serious injury. In addition, when two players start exchanging punches while others are trying to break it up, there’s always the risk of someone getting hurt by flying fists.</p>
<p>So if you’re a fan of physical hockey play, be sure to keep an eye out for potential injuries. And if you find yourself caught up in the excitement of a scrum or donnybrook, remember that everyone involved is trying to win – so try not to get too carried away!</p>
<h1 id="Minnesota-Team-Goes-Wild-In-Victory-Over-Rivals"><a href="#Minnesota-Team-Goes-Wild-In-Victory-Over-Rivals" class="headerlink" title="Minnesota Team Goes Wild In Victory Over Rivals"></a>Minnesota Team Goes Wild In Victory Over Rivals</h1><p>The Minnesota Vikings beat their rivals, the Green Bay Packers, Sunday night in a stunning victory. This was a much-needed win for the Vikings, who are now in first place in the NFC North division.</p>
<p>Minnesota got off to a quick start, scoring a touchdown on their opening drive. The Packers responded with a touchdown of their own later in the first quarter, but the Vikings scored again before halftime to take a 14-7 lead into the break.</p>
<p>Green Bay came back to tie the game in the third quarter, but Minnesota scored two more touchdowns in the fourth to take control of the game. The Packers pulled within seven points late in the fourth, but could not score again.</p>
<p>The Vikings defense played well all night, intercepting Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers twice. Cornerback Xavier Rhodes had an especially big night, intercepting Rodgers once and knocking down several passes.</p>
<p>Running back Dalvin Cook also had a big game for Minnesota, rushing for 97 yards and two touchdowns.</p>
<p>With this win, the Vikings are now in first place in the NFC North division with a 5-2 record. They will next face the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday afternoon.</p>
<h1 id="Edmonton-Oilers-vs-Minnesota-Wild-NHL-Western-Conference-Playoff-Preview"><a href="#Edmonton-Oilers-vs-Minnesota-Wild-NHL-Western-Conference-Playoff-Preview" class="headerlink" title="Edmonton Oilers vs Minnesota Wild: NHL Western Conference Playoff Preview"></a>Edmonton Oilers vs Minnesota Wild: NHL Western Conference Playoff Preview</h1><p>The Edmonton Oilers and Minnesota Wild will face off in the NHL Western Conference Playoff semifinals starting April 26. The Wild finished the regular season with a 46-29-7 record, good for 99 points and the third seed in the Western Conference. The Oilers finished the regular season with a 47-26-9 record, good for 103 points and the second seed in the Western Conference.</p>
<p>Edmonton won three out of four games against Minnesota during the regular season. The Wild’s lone victory over Edmonton came on January 14, when they defeated the Oilers 4-2. Edmonton scored nine goals over the four games against Minnesota, while allowing six.</p>
<p>Minnesota will have home ice advantage in the best-of-seven series. They are 2-2 at home in their previous four games against Edmonton this season.<br>In their last meeting on April 9, Edmonton won 5-3 behind two goals from Connor McDavid. Leon Draisaitl and Patrick Maroon also scored for the Oilers in that game. Ryan Nugent-Hopkins had three assists in that game, giving him 11 assists over his last 10 games played.</p>
<p>The Wild will likely have Erik Haula back for this series after he missed the last six games of the regular season with an injury. Without Haula, Mikko Koivu centered Zach Parise and Jason Pominville on Minnesota’s top line. Koivu finished fourth on the team with 55 points (18 goals, 37 assists) in 78 games this season. Parise led Minnesota with 34 goals this season and had 69 points (34 goals, 35 assists) in 82 games this season. Pominville tallied 58 points (20 goals, 38 assists) in 78 games this season.</p>
<p>Edmonton’s lineup is expected to be unchanged from their first round series against San Jose Sharks other than Cam Talbot getting start instead of Jonas Gustavsson who started Games 1 and 2 against San Jose. Talbot played well against San Jose, posting a 2-1 record with a 2.03 GAA and a .925 save percentage; he was named one of the three stars of each game he played during that series..</p>
<p>Ryan Strome had five points (two goals, three assists) against San Jose and will likely remain on Connor McDavid’s left wing going into this series against Minnesota.. With Jordan Eberle out due to injury, Drake Caggiula has filled in nicely on McDavid’s right wing; he had two goals and two assists against San Jose.. Milan Lucic has continued his strong play from late in the regular season into these playoffs; he has two goals and two assists so far this postseason..</p>
<p>One area where Edmonton may have an advantage over Minnesota is on defense; Oscar Klefbom averaged 24:36 minutes per game during the regular season while Ryan Suter averaged 28:32 minutes per game for Minnesota.. Klefbom is also coming off a strong series against San Jose where he recorded four points (two goals, two assists). With Brent Burns leading all playoff skaters with 12 points (five goals, seven assists), it will be important for Klefbom to continue to play well if Edmonton wants to advance to their first Stanley Cup Finals since 2006..<br>Israeli commentator Guy Lavie joins Russian commentator Andrey Osadchenko to preview Game 1 between Russia Israel </p>
<h1 id="NHL-Playoffs-Edmonton-Oilers-v-Minnesota-Wild"><a href="#NHL-Playoffs-Edmonton-Oilers-v-Minnesota-Wild" class="headerlink" title="NHL Playoffs: Edmonton Oilers v Minnesota Wild"></a>NHL Playoffs: Edmonton Oilers v Minnesota Wild</h1><p>The Oilers finished the regular season in 2nd place in the Pacific Division, while the Wild were 4th in the Central Division. This will be the 3rd time these teams have met in the playoffs, with the Oilers winning both of the previous encounters.</p>
<p>In their latest matchup on March 14th, Edmonton won by a score of 4-2. Connor McDavid had a goal and two assists for the Oilers, while Mikko Koivu led Minnesota with a goal and an assist. Edmonton goaltender Cam Talbot made 36 saves in the victory.</p>
<p>Talbot will likely start in goal again for Edmonton in this series, while Devan Dubnyk is expected to get the nod for Minnesota.</p>
<p>Dubnyk had an excellent season for Minnesota, finishing 5th in the NHL in save percentage (.923) and 8th in goals against average (2.37). However, he was pulled from Game 2 of their opening round series against St. Louis after allowing four goals on just 17 shots faced. Darcy Kuemper started Game 3 and fared no better, allowing five goals on 28 shots as Minnesota lost by a score of 7-4.</p>
<p>Minnesota will need Dubnyk to be at his best if they hope to beat Edmonton, as McDavid and Leon Draisaitl form one of the most deadly tandems in the NHL. Draisaitl finished 3rd in league scoring this season with 100 points (41 goals, 59 assists), while McDavid led the NHL with 108 points (41 goals, 67 assists).</p>
<p>Edmonton also has other dangerous offensive players such as Ryan Nugent-Hopkins (76 points), Jesse Puljujarvi (44 points), and Patrick Maroon (43 points).</p>
<p>On defense, Oscar Klefbom and Adam Larsson are a formidable duo. Klefbom had 39 points this season (13 goals, 26 assists) while Larsson added 22 points (two goals, 20 assists).</p>
<p>The Wild’s top defensive pairing is Jonas Brodin and Matt Dumba. Brodin had 32 points this year (six goals, 26 assists) while Dumba registered 43 points (20 goals, 23 assists). However, both players struggled defensively against St. Louis in the opening round series.</p>
<p>Overall, I believe that Edmonton is the better team and should win this series fairly easily. They have more firepower offensively and are better defensively than Minnesota.</p>
<h1 id="How-To-Bet-The-Wild-NHL-Hockey-Team"><a href="#How-To-Bet-The-Wild-NHL-Hockey-Team" class="headerlink" title="How To Bet The Wild NHL Hockey Team"></a>How To Bet The Wild NHL Hockey Team</h1><p>The NHL is a wildly unpredictable sport, and the betting odds reflect that. Odds can change rapidly as games are played, so it’s important to stay on top of the latest news and line changes. You can find the latest betting lines at Oddschecker.</p>
<p>Certain teams offer better value than others, so it’s important to do your research before placing a bet. The Tampa Bay Lightning are one of the best bets on the board this season, with odds of -155. The Vegas Golden Knights are also a strong team, with odds of +120.</p>
<p>It’s also important to look at which team is hot and which team is cold. The Pittsburgh Penguins are on a hot streak right now, while the Arizona Coyotes are struggling. Always take these things into account when placing your bets.</p>
<p>In the NHL, anything can happen. That’s what makes it such an exciting sport to watch - and to bet on. So don’t be afraid to take a chance on a Wild NHL Hockey Team!</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h1 id="‘IRS-Clarifies-Where-Gambling-Expenses-Can-Be-Reported-For-Oregon-Residents’"><a href="#‘IRS-Clarifies-Where-Gambling-Expenses-Can-Be-Reported-For-Oregon-Residents’" class="headerlink" title="‘IRS Clarifies Where Gambling Expenses Can Be Reported For Oregon Residents’"></a>‘IRS Clarifies Where Gambling Expenses Can Be Reported For Oregon Residents’</h1><p>Oregon residents who gamble now have some clarification from the IRS about where they should report their gambling winnings and expenses. The new IRS guidelines state that Oregon residents should report all gambling income and losses on their federal tax return, regardless of whether the gambling took place in Oregon or another state.</p>
<p>The new guidelines are in response to Oregon’s recent legalization of casino-style gambling. Oregon is one of several states that have recently legalized various forms of gambling, as the popularity of casino gaming grows nationwide.</p>
<p>The new IRS guidelines apply to all Oregon residents, not just those who gamble. So, for example, if you made a trip to Las Vegas and won $1,000 playing blackjack, you would report that income on your federal tax return. Likewise, if you lost $500 playing poker, you would deduct that amount from your income on your return.</p>
<p>The IRS has issued guidance on how to report gambling income and losses in other states as well. For example, if you live in a state that has legalized online gambling, you would report your online gambling income and losses on your federal return. If you live in a state with no legal restrictions on gambling, you would still report all your gambling income and losses on your federal return.</p>
<p>The purpose of the new IRS guidelines is to make sure that all Oregon residents are reporting their gambling income and expenses in a consistent manner. Gambling income and expenses can be complex to track and report, so these new guidelines should help taxpayers stay in compliance with the law.</p>
<h1 id="‘IRS-Issues-Guidance-On-Gambling-Expenses-Reporting-In-Oregon’"><a href="#‘IRS-Issues-Guidance-On-Gambling-Expenses-Reporting-In-Oregon’" class="headerlink" title="‘IRS Issues Guidance On Gambling Expenses Reporting In Oregon’"></a>‘IRS Issues Guidance On Gambling Expenses Reporting In Oregon’</h1><p>On Tuesday, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) released guidance on how to report gambling expenses incurred by individuals living in Oregon. The new guidance implements section 184 of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which allows taxpayers to deduct gambling losses up to the amount of their winnings.</p>
<p>The guidance document defines gambling as “the placing of bets or wagers on any game or contest of chance at any time.” It further specifies that only net losses from gambling activities may be deducted, and that losses must be itemized separately from other Miscellaneous Itemized Deductions on Schedule A.</p>
<p>Gambling income is also subject to income tax, and must be reported on Form 1040, line 21. The IRS advises taxpayers to keep accurate records of their gambling activity, including winnings and losses, in order to support any deductions taken.</p>
<p>Oregon is one of 18 states that currently allow gambling losses to be deducted from taxable income. Other states with similar provisions include California, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania.</p>
<h1 id="‘Oregon-Residents-Can-Now-Claim-Gambling-Losses-On-Their-Federal-Tax-Returns’"><a href="#‘Oregon-Residents-Can-Now-Claim-Gambling-Losses-On-Their-Federal-Tax-Returns’" class="headerlink" title="‘Oregon Residents Can Now Claim Gambling Losses On Their Federal Tax Returns’"></a>‘Oregon Residents Can Now Claim Gambling Losses On Their Federal Tax Returns’</h1><p>Oregon residents can now claim gambling losses on their federal tax returns. The state’s Department of Revenue announced the change on Feb. 1, 2018.</p>
<p>Residents had been asking for the change for years, according to Department of Revenue spokesman Bob Estabrook. “There was a lot of discussion about it,” he said. “It’s something people wanted.”</p>
<p>The new rules apply to all types of gambling, including casino games, horse racing, and online poker. To qualify, taxpayers must keep track of their winnings and losses throughout the year. Gambling income is still taxable, and taxpayers must report both wins and losses on their federal tax returns.</p>
<p>The change is expected to benefit Oregon taxpayers by about $3 million per year.</p>
<h1 id="‘Are-You-Ready-To-File-Your-Oregon-Taxes-Make-Sure-To-Include-Gambling-Losses-’"><a href="#‘Are-You-Ready-To-File-Your-Oregon-Taxes-Make-Sure-To-Include-Gambling-Losses-’" class="headerlink" title="‘Are You Ready To File Your Oregon Taxes? Make Sure To Include Gambling Losses!’"></a>‘Are You Ready To File Your Oregon Taxes? Make Sure To Include Gambling Losses!’</h1><p>As the 2017 tax season rapidly approaches, many Oregonians are starting to get their paperwork in order. This includes gathering W-2s and 1099s, as well as calculating their taxable income.</p>
<p>For those who enjoy gambling, there is another important task to take care of before filing your taxes: tallying up your gambling losses.</p>
<p>Oregon allows taxpayers to deduct their net gambling losses from their taxable income, up to the amount of their winnings. So, if you had $1,000 in gambling winnings last year but also suffered $1,200 in gambling losses, you can only claim a $200 deduction on your tax return.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you can only claim gambling losses if you itemize your deductions on Form 1040 Schedule A. If you choose the standard deduction instead, you cannot claim any losses from gambling or any other type of wagering activity.</p>
<p>There are a few other things to keep in mind when claiming gambling losses:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Gambling losses include not just money lost at casinos, but also money lost at racetracks, card clubs, and other betting activities.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gambling losses must be reported as “Other Miscellaneous Losses” on Schedule A.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You cannot claim a deduction for gambling losses if they are related to illegal activities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="‘Gambling-Expenses-Now-Legitimate-Tax-Deductions-In-Oregon’"><a href="#‘Gambling-Expenses-Now-Legitimate-Tax-Deductions-In-Oregon’" class="headerlink" title="‘Gambling Expenses Now Legitimate Tax Deductions In Oregon’"></a>‘Gambling Expenses Now Legitimate Tax Deductions In Oregon’</h1><p>Oregonians were recently thrilled to hear that their state government has deemed gambling expenses as tax-deductible. This means that any Oregonian who gambles can now legitimately write off those expenses on their taxes.</p>
<p>Governor Kate Brown made the announcement earlier this month, and it was met with a great deal of enthusiasm by the people of Oregon. According to Governor Brown, “this change is about giving Oregonians the opportunity to do what’s best for their families.”</p>
<p>Many people are already planning to take advantage of this new rule. Debbie Winters, a Salem resident, says that she’s looking forward to being able to deduct her gambling losses from her taxable income. “This is great news,” she said. “I’m going to be able to save a lot of money on my taxes this year.”</p>
<p>Not everyone is as enthusiastic about the new rule, however. Some Oregonians worry that it will encourage gambling addiction and irresponsible spending. But Governor Brown is confident that the new rule will have a positive effect overall. “The vast majority of Oregonians who gamble do so responsibly,” she said. “This change simply gives them the opportunity to offset any losses they may incur.”</p>
<p>Whatever people’s opinions might be, one thing is for sure: gambling expenses are now legitimate tax deductions in Oregon. So if you’re an Oregonian who likes to gamble, be sure to take advantage of this new rule!</p>

The program will allow eligible gamblers to purchase up to $500 worth of food per day at any MGM casino-owned restaurants.</p>
<p>MGM’s decision comes as a response to the findings of a recent study that showed that a significant number of problem gamblers are also struggling with food insecurity. “We want to do everything we can to help our guests succeed in their recovery,” said MGM CEO Jim Murren in a statement. “This new program is one way we can provide them with the support they need.”</p>
<p>The program is open to all MGM casino-goers who meet certain eligibility requirements, which include being eighteen years or older and not currently participating in another MGM-sponsored gambling support program. Participants must also have a valid government ID and provide proof of income.</p>
<p>Eligible gamblers can use the food vouchers at any of MGM’s eleven Las Vegas casinos, as well as its properties in Mississippi and Michigan. Restaurants included in the program include Emeril Lagasse’s Delmonico Steakhouse, Wolfgang Puck’s Cut and STACK, and Michael Mina’s StripSteak.</p>
<p>“The Food Support Program is going to make a big difference for me,” said recovering gambler Gary Wells. “I’ve been struggling to make ends meet, and this is going to help me get back on my feet.” Wells added that he was looking forward to trying some of the restaurants he hasn’t had a chance to visit yet.</p>
<p>MGM plans to roll out the food support program in phases, beginning on September 1st in Las Vegas and October 1st in Mississippi and Michigan. For more information or to apply for the program, visit mgmresorts.com/foodsupportprogram</p>

</li>
<li><p>You think about gambling all the time</p>
</li>
<li><p>You gamble even when you can’t afford to</p>

It can be hard to admit that you have a problem, but if you recognize any of the following signs in yourself, it might be time to seek help.</p>
<ol>
<li>You can’t resist the urge to gamble</li>
</ol>
<p>If you find yourself constantly thinking about gambling and feeling an uncontrollable urge to play, then you’re likely addicted. Gambling isn’t something that should be taken lightly - it can quickly consume your life and lead to financial ruin.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>You gamble even when you can’t afford to</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the hallmarks of addiction is compulsive behaviour, and this often includes gambling even when you can’t afford it. If you’re resorting to gambling as a way to cope with financial problems or other stressors in your life, then it’s a sign that you need help.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>You’ve lost significant amounts of money gambling</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’ve hit a rough patch financially as a result of your gambling addiction, then you’re not alone. Gambling can be extremely costly, and those who are addicted often end up losing large sums of money. This can lead to serious financial problems and even bankruptcy.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>You hide your gambling from others</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re ashamed of your gambling habit or trying to keep it a secret from family and friends, then that’s another sign that you may have a problem. Denial is common among people with addiction issues, but it’s important to get help before things spiral out of control.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Gambling becomes your only priority</li>
</ol>
<p>When gambling starts taking precedence over other things in your life - such as work, school or relationships - then it’s definitely become a problem. If gambling is all you think about and all you want to do, then it’s time to get some help.</p>
<h1 id="Do-you-have-a-gambling-problem-Here’s-how-to-find-out"><a href="#Do-you-have-a-gambling-problem-Here’s-how-to-find-out" class="headerlink" title="Do you have a gambling problem? Here’s how to find out"></a>Do you have a gambling problem? Here’s how to find out</h1><p>Gambling has been around for centuries, and while it can be fun and exciting, it can also be addictive and damaging. If you’re worried that you or someone you know might have a gambling problem, here are some signs to look out for.</p>
<ol>
<li>You gamble more than you can afford to lose.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the most obvious sign of a gambling addiction. If you find yourself constantly gambling larger and larger sums of money, even when you can’t really afford to, then you may have a problem.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Gambling has caused problems in your relationships or work life.</li>
</ol>
<p>If gambling is causing tension with your loved ones or impacting your job performance, then it’s definitely time to address the issue.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>You feel the need to gamble constantly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Do you find yourself thinking about gambling all the time? Do you feel like you can’t relax or have fun unless you’re betting on something? This is another sign of an addiction.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>You’ve lied to hide your gambling behavior.</li>
</ol>
<p>Lying about your gambling habits is a classic sign of addiction. If you’re not ready to admit that you have a problem, then there’s definitely something wrong.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>You’ve experienced financial difficulties as a result of gambling.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’ve lost money because of your gambling habit, then that’s definitely a cause for concern. Gambling can quickly drain your bank account and cause serious financial problems down the road.</p>

If you’re worried that you may be addicted to gambling, here are 10 signs that may help you identify the problem.</p>
<ol>
<li>You can’t resist the urge to gamble.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you find yourself constantly thinking about gambling and ways to get money to gamble, then it’s likely that you have a problem. Gambling should not be the focus of your life - it should be a recreational activity that you enjoy in moderation.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>You spend more time gambling than you intended to.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you find yourself gambling for longer than you planned or spending more money than you intended, then it’s a sign that your addiction is getting out of control. Cut back on your gambling activity and set some limits for yourself so that you can stay in control.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>You borrow money or sell possessions to gamble.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re resorting to risky measures like borrowing money or selling possessions in order to fund your gambling habit, then it’s definitely time to get help. Gambling should never put your financial security at risk.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>You lie about your gambling habits or expenses.</li>
</ol>
<p>Lying to friends and family about how much money you’ve lost or where you’ve been gambling is a classic sign of addiction. If you’re ashamed of your behavior, it’s time to seek help. There is no shame in asking for help dealing with an addiction - in fact, it takes a lot of strength and courage!</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>You feel anxious or depressed when you can’t gamble.</li>
</ol>
<p>If not being able to gamble makes you feel anxious or depressed, then it’s likely that your addiction has taken over your life. When gambling is no longer fun and enjoyable, but instead feels like a necessity, then it’s time to seek professional help.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>You experience withdrawal symptoms when trying to quit gambling.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>         If quitting gambling causes unpleasant symptoms like anxiety, irritability, nausea or shaking, then it means that your body has become dependent on the high that gambling provides. This is another sign that it&#39;s time to get professional help from a qualified therapist or counselor.. 7 .Your personal relationships are suffering because of your gambling addiction Gambling can take up a lot of time and energy, leaving little room for healthy relationships with friends and family members .If they complain that they never seeyou anymore or thatyou&#39;re constantly cancelling plans ,it may be becausegamblinghasbecomeapriorityinyourlife 8 .You&#39;veexperiencedfinancial problems asaresultofgambling Addictiontogamblingcanleadtowholefamilybeingfinanciallyruinedascasessuchashavebeen reported recentlyTheconvictionforgamblingdebtsorspendingtoo muchongamblingresultedinheartbreakandhumiliationforthosewhoretainthem 9 .Yougamenightandday Ifthe onlytimeyou&#39;renotthinkingaboutgamingsortryingtofindnewways torecreationalgamewasthetimeyouspentonthesleepingsofaorseeingahorizonoutsideyourwindowthenitisdefinitely timetoseekprofessionalhelp 10 .You&#39;vehadproblemswiththelawbecauseofgamb ling Ifyou&#39;vebeenarrestedorfinedbecauseofgambling-relatedbehavioritisclearlyamanifestationofaclinicalproblemthatrequires treatment

<h1 id="How-to-overcome-a-gambling-addiction"><a href="#How-to-overcome-a-gambling-addiction" class="headerlink" title="How to overcome a gambling addiction"></a>How to overcome a gambling addiction</h1><p>If you are struggling with a gambling addiction, there is hope. You can overcome your addiction and live a healthy, happy life. Here are some tips to help you get started:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get professional help.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first step in overcoming a gambling addiction is getting professional help. This may include therapy or counseling, as well as medications if needed. The professionals will help you understand your addiction and develop a treatment plan that works for you.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Identify your triggers.</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s important to identify your triggers so that you can avoid them or deal with them head on when they happen. Triggers can include things like being around other people who are gambling, being in a casino, or feeling stressed or anxious. Knowing what these triggers are will help you be better prepared to deal with them when they come up.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Avoid temptation.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you are trying to overcome an addiction, it’s important to avoid temptation as much as possible. This means staying away from places where gambling is common, like casinos and race tracks, and steering clear of activities that may lead to gambling, like betting on sports games or playing poker with friends.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Be honest about your addiction.</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s important to be honest about your addiction with the people in your life—friends, family members, and your therapist or counselor. This will help them understand what you are going through and how they can best support you during your recovery journey.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Stay positive and be patient.</li>
</ol>
<p>Recovering from a gambling addiction is not easy; it takes time and patience. But if you stay positive and work hard at overcoming your addiction, you will be successful. Celebrate each accomplishment along the way, no matter how small it may seem, and don’t let setbacks discourage you from continuing on your path to recovery</p>

        <h1 id="What-Is-the-Legitimate-Gambling-Age-in-New-Hampshire"><a href="#What-Is-the-Legitimate-Gambling-Age-in-New-Hampshire" class="headerlink" title="What Is the Legitimate Gambling Age in New Hampshire?"></a>What Is the Legitimate Gambling Age in New Hampshire?</h1><p>The legal gambling age in New Hampshire is 21 years old. This applies to all forms of gambling, including casinos, lotteries, and racetracks.</p>
<p>While the law is clear on the minimum age for gambling, there is no specific law that prohibits minors from participating in gambling activities. However, minors are not allowed to gamble at casinos or other licensed venues.</p>
<p>Parents and guardians are responsible for ensuring their children do not gamble before they reach the legal age. Penalties for violating the gambling age law include fines and/or imprisonment.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the legal gambling age in New Hampshire, contact an attorney or the state gaming commission.</p>
<h1 id="What-Is-the-Legitimate-Gambling-Age-in-Nevada"><a href="#What-Is-the-Legitimate-Gambling-Age-in-Nevada" class="headerlink" title="What Is the Legitimate Gambling Age in Nevada?"></a>What Is the Legitimate Gambling Age in Nevada?</h1><p>Though there is no federally mandated gambling age, individual states are allowed to set their own age requirements. In Nevada, the legal gambling age is 21. This applies to all forms of gambling, including casino games, lotteries, and sports betting.</p>
<p>There are some exceptions to this rule. You may gamble at the age of 18 if you are playing in a bingo or keno game in a licensed social club. And you can also gamble at the age of 18 in a tribal casino that is on tribal land.</p>
<p>There are some arguments for raising the gambling age in Nevada. One point that is often made is that casinos have become so ubiquitous, it is now harder for young people to avoid exposure to gambling. It is argued that by raising the age limit, casinos would have less exposure to underage gamblers, and this would help protect vulnerable young people from developing a gambling addiction.</p>
<p>Others argue against raising the gambling age, arguing that it would only drive underage gambling underground, where it would be harder to monitor and regulate. They also argue that most young people who gamble do so responsibly, and that any problems associated with underage gambling are better dealt with through education and prevention programs rather than by increasing the legal age limit.</p>
<h1 id="What-Is-the-Legitimate-Gambling-Age-in-Ohio"><a href="#What-Is-the-Legitimate-Gambling-Age-in-Ohio" class="headerlink" title="What Is the Legitimate Gambling Age in Ohio?"></a>What Is the Legitimate Gambling Age in Ohio?</h1><p>Ohio’s legal gambling age is 21. This is the same as the legal drinking age in the state.</p>
<p>There are several forms of legal gambling in Ohio, including casino gambling, racetrack betting, and lottery tickets. In order to participate in any of these activities, you must be at least 21 years old.</p>
<p>There are a few exceptions to the legal gambling age. For example, you can place bets on horse races when you are 18 years old. And you can play the lottery if you are at least 18 years old.</p>
<p>The legal gambling age in Ohio is set by state law. There is no federal law that sets a specific age limit for gambling. Each state determines its own legal gambling age.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure what the legal gambling age is in your state, check with your local authorities.</p>

This means that anyone 18 or older can gamble in the state. This includes playing casino games, betting on horse races, and playing lottery games.</p>
<p>There are some exceptions to this rule. People under the age of 18 can still gamble in Indian casinos if they are accompanied by an adult. There are also some pari-mutuel facilities that allow people as young as 17 to bet on horses.</p>
<p>The legal gambling age in Oklahoma is one of the lowest in the country. Only a handful of states have a lower gambling age than Oklahoma.</p>
<p>why is oklahoma’s gambling age so low?</p>
<p>There is no one answer to this question. However, there are a few potential reasons why Oklahoma has such a low gambling age.</p>
<p>One possibility is that Oklahoma sees gambling as a relatively harmless activity. Unlike alcohol or drugs, there is no scientific evidence that suggests that gambling can be addictive or harmful to your health. In fact, some research suggests that moderate levels of gambling can be beneficial to your mental health.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that Oklahoma lawmakers see gambling as a way to bring revenue into the state. Gambling generates billions of dollars in revenue every year, and Oklahoma could stand to benefit from those profits.</p>
<p>Finally, it’s possible that lawmakers simply don’t see any harm in allowing people aged 18 and older to gamble. There is no evidence that younger gamblers are more likely to experience negative consequences than older gamblers. So, there may not be much reason to restrict access to casinos and other gambling venues based on age alone.</p>
<h1 id="What-Is-the-Legitimate-Gambling-Age-in-Oregon"><a href="#What-Is-the-Legitimate-Gambling-Age-in-Oregon" class="headerlink" title="What Is the Legitimate Gambling Age in Oregon?"></a>What Is the Legitimate Gambling Age in Oregon?</h1><p>Oregon has two gambling age laws - one for casinos and one for tribal casinos. For state-licensed casinos, the minimum gambling age is 21. However, for tribal casinos, the minimum age is 18. The discrepancy between the ages for casinos is due to a federal law that gives tribes the right to self-governance on certain matters, including gambling.</p>
<p>The tribal casino gambling age of 18 has been in effect since 1990, when Congress passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA). The IGRA allows tribes to offer certain types of casino games, as long as the state in which the tribe is located permits casino gaming. In Oregon, both state-licensed and tribal casinos are allowed to offer slot machines, blackjack, craps, and other table games.</p>
<p>Some people have argued that the 18-year-old tribal gambling age should be raised to match the 21-year-old state gambling age. However, others contend that it’s not appropriate to enforce state laws on tribal lands. They argue that the tribes should be able to set their own gambling ages, just as they can set their own laws regarding other matters such as taxation and environmental regulation.</p>
<p>So far, there has been no move by Congress or the tribes themselves to change the minimum gambling age in Oregon.</p>

<p>When it comes to breaking your gambling addiction, it’s often helpful to get professional help. Therapists can provide you with guidance and support, while support groups can offer you a community of people who understand what you’re going through.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Challenge your negative thoughts and beliefs about gambling.</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the main reasons people gamble is because they have negative thoughts and beliefs about not gambling. In order to break your gambling addiction, you need to start challenging these thoughts and beliefs. Start by asking yourself if there is any evidence that supports these thoughts (and there usually isn’t). Then come up with alternative explanations for why you gamble that are more rational and realistic.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Identify your triggers and avoid them.</li>
</ol>
<p>Most people have specific things that trigger their urge to gamble. Figure out what these triggers are and then do your best to avoid them. This might mean avoiding certain types of casinos or websites, staying away from friends who gamble, or steering clear of betting shops in your neighbourhood.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Make a commitment to yourself not to gamble again.</li>
</ol>
<p>The most important thing when breaking your gambling addiction is making a commitment to yourself not to gamble again. Write down this commitment and put it somewhere where you will see it every day – like on your refrigerator or bathroom mirror. When temptation strikes, remind yourself of this commitment and how much better life will be without gambling.</p>
