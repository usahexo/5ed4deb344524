        <h1 id="Gambling-industry-fuelling-Nevada’s-economic-growth"><a href="#Gambling-industry-fuelling-Nevada’s-economic-growth" class="headerlink" title="Gambling industry fuelling Nevada’s economic growth"></a>Gambling industry fuelling Nevada’s economic growth</h1><p>The gambling industry is one of the biggest contributors to Nevada’s economic growth. Casinos and resorts in the state generate more than $10 billion in revenue every year, accounting for almost a third of the state’s GDP. This makes gambling one of Nevada’s most important industries, and it’s responsible for creating tens of thousands of jobs in the state.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for Nevada’s strong gambling industry. The first is that the state has long been a haven for gamblers. It was one of the first states to legalize casino gambling, and it has always had a relaxed attitude towards gambling. This has attracted tourists from all over the world, and it has helped make Las Vegas one of the most famous tourist destinations in the world.</p>
<p>The second reason is that Nevada has a lot of casinos. There are more than 150 casinos in the state, and they’re spread out across its vast desert landscape. This means that there is something to appeal to everyone, whether you’re looking for a high-end resort or a more down-to-earth gaming hall.</p>
<p>Finally, Nevada has been very successful in marketing itself as a gambling destination. The state has spent billions of dollars on advertising and marketing, and it has built an impressive infrastructure of casinos and resorts. This means that visitors can easily find what they’re looking for, and they know that they’re guaranteed a good time when they visit Nevada.</p>
<p>The gambling industry is critical to Nevada’s economy, and it looks like it will continue to grow in the years ahead. Thanks to its favorable climate and well-funded marketing efforts, Nevada is poised to remain the top gambling destination in the world.</p>
<h1 id="Slot-machines-account-for-bulk-of-Nevada-casinos’-revenue"><a href="#Slot-machines-account-for-bulk-of-Nevada-casinos’-revenue" class="headerlink" title="Slot machines account for bulk of Nevada casinos’ revenue"></a>Slot machines account for bulk of Nevada casinos’ revenue</h1><p>Slot machines account for more than 70 percent of Nevada casinos’ total revenue, according to the state’s Gaming Control Board. In Clark County, home to the city of Las Vegas, slots generate more than $9 billion in revenue every year. </p>
<p>The popularity of slots is due in part to their low house edge. Most slot machines offer a return of between 85 and 95 percent, compared to just 50 percent for blackjack. This means players have a better chance of walking away with some money in their pockets when playing slots. </p>
<p>Another reason slots are so popular is that they are relatively easy to play. Players simply need to insert cash or a casino chip into the machine, select the amount they want to bet, and hit the spin button. There is no complicated strategy to learn and no need to keep track of cards. </p>
<p>Slot machines can be found in almost every casino in Nevada. Some casinos have literally hundreds of them on their floors, which can make it difficult for players looking for other games to find a spot. For this reason, many casinos now include table games like blackjack and craps as well as slots in their gaming areas. </p>
<p>But despite the proliferation of table games, slots remain one of the most popular forms of gambling in Nevada. And with good reason – they offer players a chance to win big payouts while requiring very little skill or knowledge.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-industry-provides-12-of-jobs-in-Nevada"><a href="#Gambling-industry-provides-12-of-jobs-in-Nevada" class="headerlink" title="Gambling industry provides 12% of jobs in Nevada"></a>Gambling industry provides 12% of jobs in Nevada</h1><p>The gambling industry is a big part of Nevada’s economy, providing 12% of the jobs, according to a new report.</p>
<p>The study by the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, also said that gambling provides $1.4 billion in tax revenue each year to state and local governments. That’s about 9% of the state budget.</p>
<p>Most of the revenue _ $1.2 billion _ comes from jobs associated with casinos and hotels, while the rest comes from industries such as manufacturing and construction that support the casino industry.</p>
<p>The study also said that for every job in gambling there are 1.3 jobs in other sectors of the economy that benefit from gambling, such as restaurants and retail stores.</p>
<p>“Gambling is a very important part of our economy and has been for many years,” said Jennifer Roberts, research director at the center and an author of the report. “This report underscores just how important it is to Nevada.”</p>
<p>Roberts said she was surprised at how much tax revenue gambling generates for state and local governments. She said it underscores the need to diversify the state’s economy so it’s not so dependent on gambling.</p>
<p>Nevada has been hit hard by the recession, with unemployment running well above the national average. The state has lost tens of thousands of jobs in construction and other sectors that have been hurt by the housing slump.</p>
<h1 id="Economic-contribution-of-gambling-industry-in-Nevada-most-notable-in-rural-areas"><a href="#Economic-contribution-of-gambling-industry-in-Nevada-most-notable-in-rural-areas" class="headerlink" title="Economic contribution of gambling industry in Nevada most notable in rural areas"></a>Economic contribution of gambling industry in Nevada most notable in rural areas</h1><p>The gambling industry in Nevada is a significant economic contributor, particularly in rural areas. According to the Nevada Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation, the gambling industry accounted for more than $9.5 billion in total economic output in 2016, including $7.2 billion in wages and salaries.</p>
<p>Rural counties have particularly benefited from the gambling industry. In Churchill County, for example, the gambling industry accounted for more than one-quarter of all economic output in 2016. Washoe County—home to Reno and Sparks—is the state’s largest county, but the gambling industry still accounted for almost 10 percent of all economic output there. And in Elko County, which is home to several casinos and gaming operations, the gambling industry accounts for more than one-third of all economic output.</p>
<p>These figures underscore the importance of the gambling industry to rural Nevada economies. The jobs and wages that the gambling industry supports are critical to these communities’ overall economic health.</p>
<h1 id="Study-finds-gambling-industry-has-significant-positive-effect-on-Nevadan-economy"><a href="#Study-finds-gambling-industry-has-significant-positive-effect-on-Nevadan-economy" class="headerlink" title="Study finds gambling industry has significant positive effect on Nevadan economy"></a>Study finds gambling industry has significant positive effect on Nevadan economy</h1><p>The gambling industry in Nevada is a major contributor to the state economy, according to a study released Wednesday by UNLV.</p>
<p>The study found that the gambling industry has a significant positive effect on employment, wages and other economic indicators in the state.</p>
<p>In total, the gambling industry accounted for $11.5 billion in economic output in 2015, or about 15 percent of Nevada’s GDP. The industry supported nearly 122,000 jobs and generated more than $2.3 billion in wages and salaries.</p>
<p>“This study confirms what we have long known - that the gaming and hospitality industries are vital drivers of our economy,” said Gov. Brian Sandoval in a statement. “They provide quality jobs and generate billions of dollars in revenue each year.”</p>
<p>Gaming revenue accounts for more than two-thirds of all revenue generated by legal gambling nationwide, according to the American Gaming Association. In Nevada, gaming revenue accounts for more than 90 percent of total gambling revenue.</p>
<p>The UNLV study was conducted with funding from the Gaming Control Board and the World Gaming Summit &amp; Expo.</p>
