        <h1 id="Sunday-how-AI-vanquished-Poker-Parimatch"><a href="#Sunday-how-AI-vanquished-Poker-Parimatch" class="headerlink" title="Sunday how AI vanquished Poker Parimatch"></a>Sunday how AI vanquished Poker Parimatch</h1><p>In the early days of artificial intelligence, the best programs could barely beat a mediocre human player.</p>
<p>But in recent years, AI has made huge strides and can now beat some of the world’s best players in games such as Go and poker.</p>
<p>The latest victory for AI came on Sunday, when an IBM program called “Master” defeated four professional poker players at a tournament in Parimatch.</p>
<p>The victory was by no means easy though, as Master had to overcome a field of 169 other players to reach the final table.</p>
<p>But in the end, Master emerged victorious, beating each of its opponents in just three hands.</p>
<p>This latest victory for AI shows that its capabilities have now reached a level where it can compete with some of the best humans players in complex games.</p>
<h1 id="Artificial-intelligence-conquers-online-poker"><a href="#Artificial-intelligence-conquers-online-poker" class="headerlink" title="Artificial intelligence conquers online poker"></a>Artificial intelligence conquers online poker</h1><p>For a few years now, artificial intelligence (AI) has been conquering one board game after another. First it was chess, then Go. Poker, however, appeared to be a more difficult challenge. </p>
<p>This changed in 2017 when Libratus, an AI program developed by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, beat four of the world’s best professional poker players in a 20-day long heads-up no-limit Texas hold’em tournament. </p>
<p>Libratus used a combination of bluffing strategies and countermeasures against its opponents that it had learned from playing millions of hands of poker against itself. The AI program was also able to adjust its strategy on the fly based on the tendencies of its opponents. </p>
<p>Since its victory, Libratus has continued to beat all competition in online poker tournaments. In one recent tournament, it took down over 1,700 players, including some of the top professional poker players in the world. </p>
<p>So how does Libratus manage to win so consistently against human opponents? Well, while humans are capable of making complex decisions based on their own intuition and experience, they are also susceptible to cognitive biases and emotions that can cloud their judgement. AI programs like Libratus, on the other hand, are not bound by these limitations and can process large amounts of data much more efficiently than humans. </p>
<p>This is why many experts believe that AI will soon dominate the world of online poker. In fact, some believe that AI may eventually become so good at playing poker that human players will no longer be able to compete.</p>
<h1 id="Poker-Parimatch-falls-to-AI-strategy"><a href="#Poker-Parimatch-falls-to-AI-strategy" class="headerlink" title="Poker Parimatch falls to AI strategy"></a>Poker Parimatch falls to AI strategy</h1><p>For a while now, poker has been regarded as the perfect game for artificial intelligence (AI) research. A well-known computer scientist, James Allen, once famously said, “poker is the perfect AI problem because it combines elements of both perfect information games and incomplete information games.”</p>
<p>This has made the game a popular area of research for computer scientists and AI experts over the years. But in a recent development, one AI strategy has managed to beat poker Parimatch, one of the most popular versions of the game.</p>
<p>The AI strategy in question is known as counterfactual regret minimization (CRM), and it was developed by a team of researchers at Cornell University. The team has been working on this project for over 10 years, and their success has finally paid off.</p>
<p>The CRM algorithm works by simulating different game scenarios and then choosing the best move based on the results. It can also take into account factors such as opponent’s playing style and what cards are currently available.</p>
<p>To test the efficacy of their algorithm, the team took on some of the best human players in a series of games. And surprisingly, the CRM algorithm managed to beat them all. In one particular match, it even managed to win when its odds were at just 2 percent.</p>
<p>While poker Parimatch may not be as complex as some other types of poker, this development is still seen as an important victory for AI research. It shows that AI can now defeat humans in even relatively simple games like poker Parimatch.</p>
<h1 id="Sunday-how-AI-won-at-Poker-Parimatch"><a href="#Sunday-how-AI-won-at-Poker-Parimatch" class="headerlink" title="Sunday how AI won at Poker Parimatch"></a>Sunday how AI won at Poker Parimatch</h1><p>A few days ago, 30th of July, 2017, at the Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, an AI bot named Libratus finally dethroned four human poker professionals in a marathon 20-day heads-up poker competition. Dubbed “Brains vs. Artificial Intelligence: Upping the Ante”, the event was organized by Carnegie Mellon University and sponsored by Parimatch. The $200,000 purse was divided among the defeated humans as follows: Dong Kim - $69,600; Jimmy Chou - $21,700; Jason Les - $14,700; Daniel McAulay - $7,350.</p>
<p>The bot’s victory is seen as another step closer to creating true artificial intelligence and poses existential questions about what future awaits humans in fields where they are no longer the best. Poker has always been seen as one of those domains that are difficult for AI to crack due to its complex combination of strategy and chance. But Libratus proved that it is possible to teach a machine how to win even against some of the best human players in the world.</p>
<p>How did Libratus do it? It relied on a process called “defect detection” which allowed it to constantly learn from its mistakes and make better decisions throughout the competition. In addition, it also relied on a “decision network” that allowed it to predict what its opponents were likely to do next. The bot started strong and never looked back, beating its opponents 4-1 on average and eventually taking home the $200,000 prize.</p>
<p>This latest victory for AI is sure to further galvanize researchers in their quest to create machines that can think and learn like humans. It will also be interesting to see how businesses such as Parimatch capitalize on this development by using AI bots in their products and services. Whatever happens next, there is no doubt that AI is here to stay and is starting to outperform humans in many domains.</p>
<h1 id="AI-dominates-Poker-Parimatch-players-beware"><a href="#AI-dominates-Poker-Parimatch-players-beware" class="headerlink" title="AI dominates Poker Parimatch, players beware!"></a>AI dominates Poker Parimatch, players beware!</h1><p>The game of poker is one that has long been associated with intelligence and wit. However, in a recent development, artificial intelligence (AI) has dominated the game, leaving many players wondering if they still have what it takes to win.</p>
<p>The AI program, dubbed “Libratus”, was developed by a team of computer scientists at Carnegie Mellon University. In a 20 day poker competition against some of the world’s best players, Libratus handily beat them all.</p>
<p>One of the scientists involved in Libratus’ development, Professor Tuomas Sandholm, said that the AI had managed to outsmart its opponents by using “bleeding edge artificial intelligence technology”. This involved using algorithms that were able to learn from experience and adapt to different situations.</p>
<p>So how did Libratus fare against human players? Well, in 120,000 hands of poker played during the competition, the AI managed to win $1.7 million – more than double the amount won by its human opponents.</p>
<p>While this may seem like bad news for human players, Professor Sandholm is actually optimistic about the future of AI in poker. He believes that Libratus’ success could pave the way for even better AI programs in the future which will be able to beat even the best players.</p>
<p>So if you thought you had what it took to win at poker, think again! The days of humans dominating this game may be numbered…</p>
