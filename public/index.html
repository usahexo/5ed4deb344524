        <h1 id="‘IRS-Clarifies-Where-Gambling-Expenses-Can-Be-Reported-For-Oregon-Residents’"><a href="#‘IRS-Clarifies-Where-Gambling-Expenses-Can-Be-Reported-For-Oregon-Residents’" class="headerlink" title="‘IRS Clarifies Where Gambling Expenses Can Be Reported For Oregon Residents’"></a>‘IRS Clarifies Where Gambling Expenses Can Be Reported For Oregon Residents’</h1><p>Oregon residents who gamble now have some clarification from the IRS about where they should report their gambling winnings and expenses. The new IRS guidelines state that Oregon residents should report all gambling income and losses on their federal tax return, regardless of whether the gambling took place in Oregon or another state.</p>
<p>The new guidelines are in response to Oregon’s recent legalization of casino-style gambling. Oregon is one of several states that have recently legalized various forms of gambling, as the popularity of casino gaming grows nationwide.</p>
<p>The new IRS guidelines apply to all Oregon residents, not just those who gamble. So, for example, if you made a trip to Las Vegas and won $1,000 playing blackjack, you would report that income on your federal tax return. Likewise, if you lost $500 playing poker, you would deduct that amount from your income on your return.</p>
<p>The IRS has issued guidance on how to report gambling income and losses in other states as well. For example, if you live in a state that has legalized online gambling, you would report your online gambling income and losses on your federal return. If you live in a state with no legal restrictions on gambling, you would still report all your gambling income and losses on your federal return.</p>
<p>The purpose of the new IRS guidelines is to make sure that all Oregon residents are reporting their gambling income and expenses in a consistent manner. Gambling income and expenses can be complex to track and report, so these new guidelines should help taxpayers stay in compliance with the law.</p>
<h1 id="‘IRS-Issues-Guidance-On-Gambling-Expenses-Reporting-In-Oregon’"><a href="#‘IRS-Issues-Guidance-On-Gambling-Expenses-Reporting-In-Oregon’" class="headerlink" title="‘IRS Issues Guidance On Gambling Expenses Reporting In Oregon’"></a>‘IRS Issues Guidance On Gambling Expenses Reporting In Oregon’</h1><p>On Tuesday, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) released guidance on how to report gambling expenses incurred by individuals living in Oregon. The new guidance implements section 184 of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which allows taxpayers to deduct gambling losses up to the amount of their winnings.</p>
<p>The guidance document defines gambling as “the placing of bets or wagers on any game or contest of chance at any time.” It further specifies that only net losses from gambling activities may be deducted, and that losses must be itemized separately from other Miscellaneous Itemized Deductions on Schedule A.</p>
<p>Gambling income is also subject to income tax, and must be reported on Form 1040, line 21. The IRS advises taxpayers to keep accurate records of their gambling activity, including winnings and losses, in order to support any deductions taken.</p>
<p>Oregon is one of 18 states that currently allow gambling losses to be deducted from taxable income. Other states with similar provisions include California, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania.</p>
<h1 id="‘Oregon-Residents-Can-Now-Claim-Gambling-Losses-On-Their-Federal-Tax-Returns’"><a href="#‘Oregon-Residents-Can-Now-Claim-Gambling-Losses-On-Their-Federal-Tax-Returns’" class="headerlink" title="‘Oregon Residents Can Now Claim Gambling Losses On Their Federal Tax Returns’"></a>‘Oregon Residents Can Now Claim Gambling Losses On Their Federal Tax Returns’</h1><p>Oregon residents can now claim gambling losses on their federal tax returns. The state’s Department of Revenue announced the change on Feb. 1, 2018.</p>
<p>Residents had been asking for the change for years, according to Department of Revenue spokesman Bob Estabrook. “There was a lot of discussion about it,” he said. “It’s something people wanted.”</p>
<p>The new rules apply to all types of gambling, including casino games, horse racing, and online poker. To qualify, taxpayers must keep track of their winnings and losses throughout the year. Gambling income is still taxable, and taxpayers must report both wins and losses on their federal tax returns.</p>
<p>The change is expected to benefit Oregon taxpayers by about $3 million per year.</p>
<h1 id="‘Are-You-Ready-To-File-Your-Oregon-Taxes-Make-Sure-To-Include-Gambling-Losses-’"><a href="#‘Are-You-Ready-To-File-Your-Oregon-Taxes-Make-Sure-To-Include-Gambling-Losses-’" class="headerlink" title="‘Are You Ready To File Your Oregon Taxes? Make Sure To Include Gambling Losses!’"></a>‘Are You Ready To File Your Oregon Taxes? Make Sure To Include Gambling Losses!’</h1><p>As the 2017 tax season rapidly approaches, many Oregonians are starting to get their paperwork in order. This includes gathering W-2s and 1099s, as well as calculating their taxable income.</p>
<p>For those who enjoy gambling, there is another important task to take care of before filing your taxes: tallying up your gambling losses.</p>
<p>Oregon allows taxpayers to deduct their net gambling losses from their taxable income, up to the amount of their winnings. So, if you had $1,000 in gambling winnings last year but also suffered $1,200 in gambling losses, you can only claim a $200 deduction on your tax return.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you can only claim gambling losses if you itemize your deductions on Form 1040 Schedule A. If you choose the standard deduction instead, you cannot claim any losses from gambling or any other type of wagering activity.</p>
<p>There are a few other things to keep in mind when claiming gambling losses:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Gambling losses include not just money lost at casinos, but also money lost at racetracks, card clubs, and other betting activities.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gambling losses must be reported as “Other Miscellaneous Losses” on Schedule A.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You cannot claim a deduction for gambling losses if they are related to illegal activities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="‘Gambling-Expenses-Now-Legitimate-Tax-Deductions-In-Oregon’"><a href="#‘Gambling-Expenses-Now-Legitimate-Tax-Deductions-In-Oregon’" class="headerlink" title="‘Gambling Expenses Now Legitimate Tax Deductions In Oregon’"></a>‘Gambling Expenses Now Legitimate Tax Deductions In Oregon’</h1><p>Oregonians were recently thrilled to hear that their state government has deemed gambling expenses as tax-deductible. This means that any Oregonian who gambles can now legitimately write off those expenses on their taxes.</p>
<p>Governor Kate Brown made the announcement earlier this month, and it was met with a great deal of enthusiasm by the people of Oregon. According to Governor Brown, “this change is about giving Oregonians the opportunity to do what’s best for their families.”</p>
<p>Many people are already planning to take advantage of this new rule. Debbie Winters, a Salem resident, says that she’s looking forward to being able to deduct her gambling losses from her taxable income. “This is great news,” she said. “I’m going to be able to save a lot of money on my taxes this year.”</p>
<p>Not everyone is as enthusiastic about the new rule, however. Some Oregonians worry that it will encourage gambling addiction and irresponsible spending. But Governor Brown is confident that the new rule will have a positive effect overall. “The vast majority of Oregonians who gamble do so responsibly,” she said. “This change simply gives them the opportunity to offset any losses they may incur.”</p>
<p>Whatever people’s opinions might be, one thing is for sure: gambling expenses are now legitimate tax deductions in Oregon. So if you’re an Oregonian who likes to gamble, be sure to take advantage of this new rule!</p>

The program will allow eligible gamblers to purchase up to $500 worth of food per day at any MGM casino-owned restaurants.</p>
<p>MGM’s decision comes as a response to the findings of a recent study that showed that a significant number of problem gamblers are also struggling with food insecurity. “We want to do everything we can to help our guests succeed in their recovery,” said MGM CEO Jim Murren in a statement. “This new program is one way we can provide them with the support they need.”</p>
<p>The program is open to all MGM casino-goers who meet certain eligibility requirements, which include being eighteen years or older and not currently participating in another MGM-sponsored gambling support program. Participants must also have a valid government ID and provide proof of income.</p>
<p>Eligible gamblers can use the food vouchers at any of MGM’s eleven Las Vegas casinos, as well as its properties in Mississippi and Michigan. Restaurants included in the program include Emeril Lagasse’s Delmonico Steakhouse, Wolfgang Puck’s Cut and STACK, and Michael Mina’s StripSteak.</p>
<p>“The Food Support Program is going to make a big difference for me,” said recovering gambler Gary Wells. “I’ve been struggling to make ends meet, and this is going to help me get back on my feet.” Wells added that he was looking forward to trying some of the restaurants he hasn’t had a chance to visit yet.</p>
<p>MGM plans to roll out the food support program in phases, beginning on September 1st in Las Vegas and October 1st in Mississippi and Michigan. For more information or to apply for the program, visit mgmresorts.com/foodsupportprogram</p>

Here are some signs that you may be addicted to gambling:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can’t resist the urge to gamble, no matter how much you lose</p>
</li>
<li><p>You think about gambling all the time</p>
</li>
<li><p>You gamble even when you can’t afford to</p>
</li>
<li><p>You’ve lied to your loved ones about how much you’ve been gambling</p>
</li>
<li><p>You feel depressed or anxious when you can’t gamble</p>
</li>
<li><p>You’re unable to control your gambling habits</p>

It can be hard to admit that you have a problem, but if you recognize any of the following signs in yourself, it might be time to seek help.</p>
<ol>
<li>You can’t resist the urge to gamble</li>
</ol>
<p>If you find yourself constantly thinking about gambling and feeling an uncontrollable urge to play, then you’re likely addicted. Gambling isn’t something that should be taken lightly - it can quickly consume your life and lead to financial ruin.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>You gamble even when you can’t afford to</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the hallmarks of addiction is compulsive behaviour, and this often includes gambling even when you can’t afford it. If you’re resorting to gambling as a way to cope with financial problems or other stressors in your life, then it’s a sign that you need help.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>You’ve lost significant amounts of money gambling</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’ve hit a rough patch financially as a result of your gambling addiction, then you’re not alone. Gambling can be extremely costly, and those who are addicted often end up losing large sums of money. This can lead to serious financial problems and even bankruptcy.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>You hide your gambling from others</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re ashamed of your gambling habit or trying to keep it a secret from family and friends, then that’s another sign that you may have a problem. Denial is common among people with addiction issues, but it’s important to get help before things spiral out of control.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Gambling becomes your only priority</li>
</ol>
<p>When gambling starts taking precedence over other things in your life - such as work, school or relationships - then it’s definitely become a problem. If gambling is all you think about and all you want to do, then it’s time to get some help.</p>
<h1 id="Do-you-have-a-gambling-problem-Here’s-how-to-find-out"><a href="#Do-you-have-a-gambling-problem-Here’s-how-to-find-out" class="headerlink" title="Do you have a gambling problem? Here’s how to find out"></a>Do you have a gambling problem? Here’s how to find out</h1><p>Gambling has been around for centuries, and while it can be fun and exciting, it can also be addictive and damaging. If you’re worried that you or someone you know might have a gambling problem, here are some signs to look out for.</p>
<ol>
<li>You gamble more than you can afford to lose.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the most obvious sign of a gambling addiction. If you find yourself constantly gambling larger and larger sums of money, even when you can’t really afford to, then you may have a problem.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Gambling has caused problems in your relationships or work life.</li>
</ol>
<p>If gambling is causing tension with your loved ones or impacting your job performance, then it’s definitely time to address the issue.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>You feel the need to gamble constantly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Do you find yourself thinking about gambling all the time? Do you feel like you can’t relax or have fun unless you’re betting on something? This is another sign of an addiction.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>You’ve lied to hide your gambling behavior.</li>
</ol>
<p>Lying about your gambling habits is a classic sign of addiction. If you’re not ready to admit that you have a problem, then there’s definitely something wrong.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>You’ve experienced financial difficulties as a result of gambling.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’ve lost money because of your gambling habit, then that’s definitely a cause for concern. Gambling can quickly drain your bank account and cause serious financial problems down the road.</p>
<h1 id="10-ways-to-know-if-you’re-addicted-to-gambling"><a href="#10-ways-to-know-if-you’re-addicted-to-gambling" class="headerlink" title="10 ways to know if you’re addicted to gambling"></a>10 ways to know if you’re addicted to gambling</h1><p>Gambling addiction is a serious problem that many people struggle with. If you’re worried that you may be addicted to gambling, here are 10 signs that may help you identify the problem.</p>
<ol>
<li>You can’t resist the urge to gamble.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you find yourself constantly thinking about gambling and ways to get money to gamble, then it’s likely that you have a problem. Gambling should not be the focus of your life - it should be a recreational activity that you enjoy in moderation.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>You spend more time gambling than you intended to.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you find yourself gambling for longer than you planned or spending more money than you intended, then it’s a sign that your addiction is getting out of control. Cut back on your gambling activity and set some limits for yourself so that you can stay in control.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>You borrow money or sell possessions to gamble.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re resorting to risky measures like borrowing money or selling possessions in order to fund your gambling habit, then it’s definitely time to get help. Gambling should never put your financial security at risk.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>You lie about your gambling habits or expenses.</li>
</ol>
<p>Lying to friends and family about how much money you’ve lost or where you’ve been gambling is a classic sign of addiction. If you’re ashamed of your behavior, it’s time to seek help. There is no shame in asking for help dealing with an addiction - in fact, it takes a lot of strength and courage!</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>You feel anxious or depressed when you can’t gamble.</li>
</ol>
<p>If not being able to gamble makes you feel anxious or depressed, then it’s likely that your addiction has taken over your life. When gambling is no longer fun and enjoyable, but instead feels like a necessity, then it’s time to seek professional help.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>You experience withdrawal symptoms when trying to quit gambling.</li>

You can overcome your addiction and live a healthy, happy life. Here are some tips to help you get started:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get professional help.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first step in overcoming a gambling addiction is getting professional help. This may include therapy or counseling, as well as medications if needed. The professionals will help you understand your addiction and develop a treatment plan that works for you.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Identify your triggers.</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s important to identify your triggers so that you can avoid them or deal with them head on when they happen. Triggers can include things like being around other people who are gambling, being in a casino, or feeling stressed or anxious. Knowing what these triggers are will help you be better prepared to deal with them when they come up.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Avoid temptation.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you are trying to overcome an addiction, it’s important to avoid temptation as much as possible. This means staying away from places where gambling is common, like casinos and race tracks, and steering clear of activities that may lead to gambling, like betting on sports games or playing poker with friends.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Be honest about your addiction.</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s important to be honest about your addiction with the people in your life—friends, family members, and your therapist or counselor. This will help them understand what you are going through and how they can best support you during your recovery journey.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Stay positive and be patient.</li>
</ol>
<p>Recovering from a gambling addiction is not easy; it takes time and patience. But if you stay positive and work hard at overcoming your addiction, you will be successful. Celebrate each accomplishment along the way, no matter how small it may seem, and don’t let setbacks discourage you from continuing on your path to recovery</p>

        <h1 id="What-Is-the-Legitimate-Gambling-Age-in-New-Hampshire"><a href="#What-Is-the-Legitimate-Gambling-Age-in-New-Hampshire" class="headerlink" title="What Is the Legitimate Gambling Age in New Hampshire?"></a>What Is the Legitimate Gambling Age in New Hampshire?</h1><p>The legal gambling age in New Hampshire is 21 years old. This applies to all forms of gambling, including casinos, lotteries, and racetracks.</p>
<p>While the law is clear on the minimum age for gambling, there is no specific law that prohibits minors from participating in gambling activities. However, minors are not allowed to gamble at casinos or other licensed venues.</p>
<p>Parents and guardians are responsible for ensuring their children do not gamble before they reach the legal age. Penalties for violating the gambling age law include fines and/or imprisonment.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the legal gambling age in New Hampshire, contact an attorney or the state gaming commission.</p>
<h1 id="What-Is-the-Legitimate-Gambling-Age-in-Nevada"><a href="#What-Is-the-Legitimate-Gambling-Age-in-Nevada" class="headerlink" title="What Is the Legitimate Gambling Age in Nevada?"></a>What Is the Legitimate Gambling Age in Nevada?</h1><p>Though there is no federally mandated gambling age, individual states are allowed to set their own age requirements. In Nevada, the legal gambling age is 21. This applies to all forms of gambling, including casino games, lotteries, and sports betting.</p>
<p>There are some exceptions to this rule. You may gamble at the age of 18 if you are playing in a bingo or keno game in a licensed social club. And you can also gamble at the age of 18 in a tribal casino that is on tribal land.</p>
<p>There are some arguments for raising the gambling age in Nevada. One point that is often made is that casinos have become so ubiquitous, it is now harder for young people to avoid exposure to gambling. It is argued that by raising the age limit, casinos would have less exposure to underage gamblers, and this would help protect vulnerable young people from developing a gambling addiction.</p>
<p>Others argue against raising the gambling age, arguing that it would only drive underage gambling underground, where it would be harder to monitor and regulate. They also argue that most young people who gamble do so responsibly, and that any problems associated with underage gambling are better dealt with through education and prevention programs rather than by increasing the legal age limit.</p>
<h1 id="What-Is-the-Legitimate-Gambling-Age-in-Ohio"><a href="#What-Is-the-Legitimate-Gambling-Age-in-Ohio" class="headerlink" title="What Is the Legitimate Gambling Age in Ohio?"></a>What Is the Legitimate Gambling Age in Ohio?</h1><p>Ohio’s legal gambling age is 21. This is the same as the legal drinking age in the state.</p>
<p>There are several forms of legal gambling in Ohio, including casino gambling, racetrack betting, and lottery tickets. In order to participate in any of these activities, you must be at least 21 years old.</p>
<p>There are a few exceptions to the legal gambling age. For example, you can place bets on horse races when you are 18 years old. And you can play the lottery if you are at least 18 years old.</p>
<p>The legal gambling age in Ohio is set by state law. There is no federal law that sets a specific age limit for gambling. Each state determines its own legal gambling age.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure what the legal gambling age is in your state, check with your local authorities.</p>
<h1 id="What-Is-the-Legitimate-Gambling-Age-in-Oklahoma"><a href="#What-Is-the-Legitimate-Gambling-Age-in-Oklahoma" class="headerlink" title="What Is the Legitimate Gambling Age in Oklahoma?"></a>What Is the Legitimate Gambling Age in Oklahoma?</h1><p>Oklahoma has a legal gambling age of 18. This means that anyone 18 or older can gamble in the state. This includes playing casino games, betting on horse races, and playing lottery games.</p>
<p>There are some exceptions to this rule. People under the age of 18 can still gamble in Indian casinos if they are accompanied by an adult. There are also some pari-mutuel facilities that allow people as young as 17 to bet on horses.</p>
<p>The legal gambling age in Oklahoma is one of the lowest in the country. Only a handful of states have a lower gambling age than Oklahoma.</p>
<p>why is oklahoma’s gambling age so low?</p>
<p>There is no one answer to this question. However, there are a few potential reasons why Oklahoma has such a low gambling age.</p>
<p>One possibility is that Oklahoma sees gambling as a relatively harmless activity. Unlike alcohol or drugs, there is no scientific evidence that suggests that gambling can be addictive or harmful to your health. In fact, some research suggests that moderate levels of gambling can be beneficial to your mental health.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that Oklahoma lawmakers see gambling as a way to bring revenue into the state. Gambling generates billions of dollars in revenue every year, and Oklahoma could stand to benefit from those profits.</p>
<p>Finally, it’s possible that lawmakers simply don’t see any harm in allowing people aged 18 and older to gamble. There is no evidence that younger gamblers are more likely to experience negative consequences than older gamblers. So, there may not be much reason to restrict access to casinos and other gambling venues based on age alone.</p>
<h1 id="What-Is-the-Legitimate-Gambling-Age-in-Oregon"><a href="#What-Is-the-Legitimate-Gambling-Age-in-Oregon" class="headerlink" title="What Is the Legitimate Gambling Age in Oregon?"></a>What Is the Legitimate Gambling Age in Oregon?</h1><p>Oregon has two gambling age laws - one for casinos and one for tribal casinos. For state-licensed casinos, the minimum gambling age is 21. However, for tribal casinos, the minimum age is 18. The discrepancy between the ages for casinos is due to a federal law that gives tribes the right to self-governance on certain matters, including gambling.</p>
<p>The tribal casino gambling age of 18 has been in effect since 1990, when Congress passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA). The IGRA allows tribes to offer certain types of casino games, as long as the state in which the tribe is located permits casino gaming. In Oregon, both state-licensed and tribal casinos are allowed to offer slot machines, blackjack, craps, and other table games.</p>
<p>Some people have argued that the 18-year-old tribal gambling age should be raised to match the 21-year-old state gambling age. However, others contend that it’s not appropriate to enforce state laws on tribal lands. They argue that the tribes should be able to set their own gambling ages, just as they can set their own laws regarding other matters such as taxation and environmental regulation.</p>
<p>So far, there has been no move by Congress or the tribes themselves to change the minimum gambling age in Oregon.</p>

</ol>
<p>One of the main reasons people gamble is because they have negative thoughts and beliefs about not gambling. In order to break your gambling addiction, you need to start challenging these thoughts and beliefs.

Then come up with alternative explanations for why you gamble that are more rational and realistic.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Identify your triggers and avoid them.</li>
</ol>
<p>Most people have specific things that trigger their urge to gamble. Figure out what these triggers are and then do your best to avoid them. This might mean avoiding certain types of casinos or websites, staying away from friends who gamble, or steering clear of betting shops in your neighbourhood.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Make a commitment to yourself not to gamble again.</li>
</ol>
<p>The most important thing when breaking your gambling addiction is making a commitment to yourself not to gamble again. Write down this commitment and put it somewhere where you will see it every day – like on your refrigerator or bathroom mirror. When temptation strikes, remind yourself of this commitment and how much better life will be without gambling.</p>

The most common option is to tip a percentage of the amount won during the session. So, how much should you tip your dealer?</p>
<p>The typical range for tipping blackjack dealers is between $1 and $5 per hand. If you’re winning, it’s generally polite to tip more than if you’re losing. Some people also tip based on the quality of service they receive from the dealer.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that your tips are greatly appreciated by casino staff. They work hard to make your experience enjoyable and rewarding, so be sure to show your gratitude with a well-deserved tip!</p>

<p>There really isn’t a right or wrong answer, it’s all about what feels comfortable for you. You could simply round up your winnings to the nearest dollar and give the dealer that, or you could add a bit more on top depending on how impressed you were with their performance.</p>
<p>Some people like to leave $5 for every $100 won, while others may give a little more or less depending on the situation. It’s really up to you and your personal preferences. Just make sure that whatever amount you choose to give is consistent each time so that the dealers know what to expect.</p>

The answer to this question isn’t as straightforward as one might think.</p>
<p>There is no universal answer when it comes to tipping blackjack dealers. It really depends on the casino, the dealer’s attitude and your own personal preferences. However, a good rule of thumb is to tip between $1 and $5 per hand, depending on the circumstances.</p>
<p>If you’re winning, you may want to consider tipping more than if you’re losing. And if the dealer is particularly friendly or helpful, you may want to tip more than if they’re just doing their job.</p>
<p>Tipping is not mandatory, but it is generally appreciated by dealers. So if you can spare a few dollars, it’s a nice way to show your appreciation for a job well done.</p>
<h1 id="The-Definitive-Guide-to-Tipping-for-Blackjack"><a href="#The-Definitive-Guide-to-Tipping-for-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="The Definitive Guide to Tipping for Blackjack"></a>The Definitive Guide to Tipping for Blackjack</h1><p> slot of casino games come with a built-in house edge, but blackjack is not one of them. In fact, if you play perfect blackjack strategy, your odds of winning are very close to even. That’s why blackjack is one of the most popular casino games – it offers gamblers a fair chance at winning real money.</p>
<p>One thing that can tilt the odds in your favor though, is using the right strategy when it comes to tipping the dealer. In this article, we’re going to go over the basics of tipping for blackjack, as well as some specific scenarios where it might be advantageous to do so.</p>
<p>When it comes to tipping the dealer, there are no hard and fast rules; it’s ultimately up to you how much you want to give. However, a good rule of thumb is to tip between 10 and 20 percent of your total winnings for the hand. So if you win $100 on a hand, you would tip between $10 and $20.</p>
<p>There are two main reasons why you might want to tip the dealer: to show your appreciation for a job well done, and to gain an edge in future hands. Let’s take a look at each scenario in more detail.</p>
<p>If you’re happy with the dealer’s performance – for example, they didn’t make any mistakes and dealt cards quickly and efficiently – then a small token of appreciation is in order. A $1 or $2 tip is generally enough; anything more than that may seem excessive.</p>
<p>However, if you feel that the dealer made mistakes that cost you money – for example, they didn’t give you back your bet when they should have, or they dealt out an extra card when they shouldn’t have – then tipping them can help offset those errors somewhat. Tipping 10 percent of your winnings for the hand can help make up for these kind of mistakes, and can help ensure that you get fair treatment from the dealer in future hands.</p>
<p>Of course, whether or not you decide to tip the dealer is ultimately up to you; there’s no guarantee that tipping will give you an edge in future hands. But if you’re looking for a way to increase your chances of winning at blackjack, tipping the dealer could be a good strategy to try out.</p>
<h1 id="How-much-should-you-really-tip-your-blackjack-dealer"><a href="#How-much-should-you-really-tip-your-blackjack-dealer" class="headerlink" title="How much should you really tip your blackjack dealer?"></a>How much should you really tip your blackjack dealer?</h1><p>Most people would agree that when it comes to gratuity, servers and service industry workers should be the ones who receive the bulk of the generosity. After all, they are the ones who are providing a personal service and often go above and beyond to ensure customer satisfaction. But what about blackjack dealers? How much should you really tip them?</p>
<p>The answer to this question is not as clear-cut as with other service workers. For one, blackjack dealers are not always tipped, even though they arguably provide a valuable service. And if they are tipped, the amount can vary significantly depending on the casino, the location within the casino, and even the dealer’s personality.</p>
<p>In general, however, most experts agree that tipping blackjack dealers is not necessary, but is certainly appreciated. And if you do decide to tip your dealer, anywhere from $1 to $5 per hand is generally considered appropriate.</p>

In both cases, the goal is to create a situation that gives the house an edge over the player.</p>
<p>In blackjack, the casino can achieve this by dealing out more conservative hands to players. For sporting clays, the casino can make it more difficult for shooters to hit their targets by placing obstacles in their way.</p>
<p>Both blackjack and sporting clays offer the house a small advantage that can add up over time. This is why casino profits from these activities are so significant.</p>

<h1 id="The-Casino-Edge-in-Blackjack-and-Sporting-Clays"><a href="#The-Casino-Edge-in-Blackjack-and-Sporting-Clays" class="headerlink" title="The Casino Edge in Blackjack and Sporting Clays"></a>The Casino Edge in Blackjack and Sporting Clays</h1><p>The casino enjoys a mathematical edge in blackjack and sporting clays. In blackjack, the dealer has a slight advantage over the player. This is due to the fact that the dealer must hit on soft 17s, while players may stand. In addition, dealers are more likely to bust than players. The casino’s edge in blackjack is about 0.5%.</p>
<p>The casino also enjoys a significant edge in sporting clays. This is because shooters are more likely to miss targets than hit them. The casino’s edge in sporting clays is about 5%.</p>
<h1 id="Profiting-from-Blackjack-and-Sporting-Clays-at-the-Casino"><a href="#Profiting-from-Blackjack-and-Sporting-Clays-at-the-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Profiting from Blackjack and Sporting Clays at the Casino"></a>Profiting from Blackjack and Sporting Clays at the Casino</h1><p>There are excellent opportunities for casino-goers to profit from blackjack and sporting clays in the gambling mecca of Reno, Nevada. For blackjack, The Sands Regency offers a 6:5 payout on blackjacks instead of the more common 3:2 payout. This presents a significant opportunity for players to increase their profits. In addition, Reno offers several casinos with sporting clay facilities, including Grand Sierra Resort and Casino, Peppermill Reno Casino Spa Resort, and Boomtown Reno Hotel Casino. These casinos offer shooting packages that include gun rental, shells, targets, and instruction. Players can shoot 100 rounds for as little as $25. Shooting packages at these casinos can provide players with hours of fun and a potential profit opportunity.</p>
<h1 id="Playing-Blackjack-and-Sporting-Clays-for-Profit"><a href="#Playing-Blackjack-and-Sporting-Clays-for-Profit" class="headerlink" title="Playing Blackjack and Sporting Clays for Profit"></a>Playing Blackjack and Sporting Clays for Profit</h1><p>In the casino game of blackjack, the house edge is about 0.5 percent. In sporting clays, it can be more than double that. So if you are looking to make a profit playing games of chance, blackjack is the better option.</p>
<p>That said, there is still money to be made playing sporting clays. The key is to find competitions with low entry fees and respectable payouts. For example, a recent tournament in my area offered a $500 first prize and only cost $50 to enter. With a 10 percent payout, that’s a potential return of $10 on your investment.</p>
<p>Of course, you’ll need to be reasonably good at sporting clays to have any chance of winning these tournaments. But even if you don’t take home the top prize, there’s still a good chance of breaking even or making a small profit.</p>
<p>So if you are looking for a fun (and potentially profitable) way to spend an afternoon or weekend, give blackjack or sporting clays a try!</p>

        <h1 id="Winning-the-lottery-at-a-casino-in-Nevada-comes-with-a-hefty-tax-bill"><a href="#Winning-the-lottery-at-a-casino-in-Nevada-comes-with-a-hefty-tax-bill" class="headerlink" title="Winning the lottery at a casino in Nevada comes with a hefty tax bill!"></a>Winning the lottery at a casino in Nevada comes with a hefty tax bill!</h1><p>When people win the lottery at a casino in Nevada, they are often surprised to learn that they have to pay taxes on their prize. In fact, the tax bill can be quite hefty, as the state taxes gambling winnings at a rate of 8.1%. This means that a winning ticket of $100,000 would result in a tax bill of $8,100.</p>
<p>While this may seem like a lot, it is important to remember that the tax rates in Nevada are much lower than in other states. For example, New York State taxes gambling winnings at a rate of 8.82%, while California taxes them at a rate of 13.3%. Therefore, if you live in one of these states and won the lottery at a casino there, you would have to pay considerably more in taxes than you would if you won the lottery in Nevada.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind if you do win the lottery at a casino is that you will not be able to keep all of your winnings. In most cases, casinos will withhold 25% of your prize for federal taxes. So if you won $100,000, the casino would only payout $75,000. This means that you would still have to pay federal taxes on your winnings, even if you don’t receive all of the money at once.</p>
<p>So if you’re lucky enough to win big at a casino in Nevada, be prepared to pay some hefty taxes!</p>
<h1 id="How-to-pay-taxes-on-a-Nevada-casino-jackpot-win"><a href="#How-to-pay-taxes-on-a-Nevada-casino-jackpot-win" class="headerlink" title="How to pay taxes on a Nevada casino jackpot win"></a>How to pay taxes on a Nevada casino jackpot win</h1><p>If you hit a big jackpot at a Nevada casino, you may be wondering how and when you have to pay taxes on your winnings. </p>
<p>The good news is that most gambling winnings are tax-free. However, there are a few exceptions, and one of them is casino jackpots. </p>
<p>U.S. federal taxes must be paid on any gambling winnings over $5,000. This includes both taxable and nontaxable amounts. So, if you hit a $10,000 jackpot, for example, you would owe U.S. federal taxes on $5,000 of the winnings. </p>
<p>Casino jackpots are considered taxable income in the same way as regular income earned through employment or investments. So, you will likely have to pay income tax and maybe even Social Security and Medicare taxes on your jackpot winnings. </p>
<p>How much you end up paying in taxes will depend on your individual tax bracket. The good news is that most people won’t have to pay too much in taxes on their casino jackpot winnings, especially if they don’t have other high-income sources. </p>
<p>However, it’s important to remember that you can’t just avoid taxes altogether by cashing out your jackpot in smaller chunks over time. The U.S. government will still expect you to report all of your gambling winnings in the year that you earn them – even if you take the money out in installments. </p>
<p>If you do have to pay taxes on your casino jackpot winnings, there are a few ways to reduce the amount you owe. First of all, make sure to keep accurate records of all your gambling activity so that you can accurately report your earnings when it comes time to file your tax return. </p>
<p>You may also be able to claim a gambling loss deduction if you incurred losses while gambling during the year. This can help offset some of the taxes that you owe on your winnings. </p>
<p>Finally, be sure to speak with a tax professional if you have any questions or concerns about paying taxes on your casino jackpot winnings – they can help ensure that everything is handled correctly and that you don’t end up owing more than necessary!</p>
<h1 id="When-do-you-have-to-pay-taxes-on-a-Nevada-casino-jackpot"><a href="#When-do-you-have-to-pay-taxes-on-a-Nevada-casino-jackpot" class="headerlink" title="When do you have to pay taxes on a Nevada casino jackpot?"></a>When do you have to pay taxes on a Nevada casino jackpot?</h1><p>In Nevada, when do you have to pay taxes on a casino jackpot? The answer to this question is not as straightforward as one might think.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, when a person wins a large sum of money from a casino, they are required to report that income to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In most cases, this applies to any winnings in excess of $5,000. However, taxation on casino jackpots can be more complicated than simply reporting the amount won. For example, if a person incurs gambling losses during the year which exceed their gambling winnings, they may be able to reduce their tax liability on the jackpot by claiming those losses.</p>
<p>Another factor which can impact the tax liability on casino jackpots is where the winnings were earned. Certain states have tax laws which are more favorable to gamblers than others. In Nevada, for example, there is no state income tax. This means that gamblers who win big jackpots in Nevada casinos will not owe any state taxes on their earnings. </p>
<p>However, players should keep in mind that they are still obligated to report any casino jackpot winnings on their federal income tax return. And while there may be some benefits to winning a jackpot in a state without an income tax, there are also other factors to consider. For example, many states have higher sales and property taxes than Nevada. So while it might be advantageous for a gambler to win a large jackpot in a no-income-tax state like Nevada, they would need to take into account all of the other taxes they would owe on their winnings if they lived in another state. </p>
<p>In conclusion, there is no single answer to the question of when you have to pay taxes on a casino jackpot. The amount of tax you owe will depend on a number of factors including the size of your winnings, your filing status and residency status, and whether you have any gambling losses for the year which can be used to offset your taxable income.</p>
<h1 id="Taxes-on-casino-jackpots-in-Nevada-when-do-you-have-to-pay-up"><a href="#Taxes-on-casino-jackpots-in-Nevada-when-do-you-have-to-pay-up" class="headerlink" title="Taxes on casino jackpots in Nevada: when do you have to pay up?"></a>Taxes on casino jackpots in Nevada: when do you have to pay up?</h1><p>Casino jackpots in Nevada can be sizable, and it’s important to know when and how you have to pay taxes on any winnings. Generally, you’ll have to report any gambling income on your tax return, and there are a few different ways that the tax code handles casino jackpots.</p>
<p>The default rule is that casino jackpots are considered taxable income in the year they’re won. This means that you’ll have to report the full amount of the jackpot as income on your tax return for the year in which you won it. If you’re lucky enough to hit a huge jackpot, this could push you into a higher tax bracket and result in a larger tax bill.</p>
<p>There is an exception to this rule for gambling losses, however. You can deduct your losses from any winnings that you report on your tax return, which can help reduce your overall tax liability. So if you hit a $100,000 jackpot but had $10,000 in gambling losses during the year, you’d only have to report $90,000 in taxable income.</p>
<p>Another exception applies if the jackpot is paid out over multiple years. In this case, you only have to include the taxable portion of the jackpot in your income for the year in which it was first received. So if you hit a $1 million jackpot but receive payments over 10 years, you’d only include $100,000 in income for the year in which you hit the jackpot. This exception is designed to prevent people from having to pay taxes on money they haven’t actually received yet.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s a special rule for slot machines. If you hit a jackpot on a slot machine, the first $1,200 of winnings is not taxable. This rule is designed to avoid putting too much of a burden on small wins at slot machines. Any amount over $1,200 is subject to regular income taxes.</p>
<p>As with most things related to taxes, there’s no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to casino jackpots. You’ll need to talk to an accountant or tax professional to figure out how these rules apply specifically to your situation. But knowing about these different rules can help make sure that you don’t end up paying too much in taxes on those big wins at the casino.</p>
<h1 id="Get-ready-to-pay-taxes-on-your-Nevada-casino-jackpot-win"><a href="#Get-ready-to-pay-taxes-on-your-Nevada-casino-jackpot-win" class="headerlink" title="Get ready to pay taxes on your Nevada casino jackpot win!"></a>Get ready to pay taxes on your Nevada casino jackpot win!</h1><p>The Nevada state government is reminding casino jackpot winners that they are required to pay taxes on their winnings. This applies to both residents and non-residents of Nevada.</p>
<p>In order to ensure that the necessary taxes are paid, the Nevada Department of taxation will be working with casinos to obtain winner information. This includes the amount of the jackpot, as well as the name and Social Security number of the winner.</p>
<p>If you are a casino jackpot winner, it is important to understand your tax obligations. Here are a few things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Taxable winnings include cash, chips, and other items of value related to casino gaming.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Winnings are subject to state and federal taxes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The amount of tax you owe will depend on your taxable income and filing status.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You may be able to claim a tax deduction for gambling losses incurred during the year.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to consult with a tax professional if you have any questions about how to report your casino jackpot winnings. The tax professionals at {company} can help you understand your tax obligations and file your return correctly.</p>

#  Just How Shut Is The Courtyard Marriott To Emerald Queen Casino Play Luckyland Slots?

The Courtyard Marriott is one of the closest hotels to Emerald Queen Casino, located only 0.2 miles away. This means it's within walking distance, and many guests choose to take advantage of this proximity by playing Luckyland Slots while they're in town.

But just how shut is the Courtyard Marriott to Emerald Queen Casino? We did some research to find out.

 emerald-queen-casino-play-luckyland-slots

According to Google Maps, it takes only 2 minutes and 20 seconds to walk from the front door of the Courtyard Marriott to the entrance of Emerald Queen Casino. That's pretty close!

In fact, it's so close that many guests probably choose to simply walk over to the casino rather than driving there. This can be a great way to save on parking fees, and it also eliminates the risk of losing your spot if you have to leave for a bit.

And if you're looking for a place to stay near Emerald Queen Casino, the Courtyard Marriott is a great option. With comfortable rooms and excellent amenities, it's perfect for any casino visit.

#  How Tightly Shut Is The Courtyard Marriott To Emerald Queen Casino Play Luckyland Slots?

The Emerald Queen Casino (EQC) and the Courtyard Marriott Tacoma Downtown have been inextricably linked since the casino’s inception in 1994. The signature of the $100 million deal that brought the casino to Tacoma was a provisions granting the Marriott an exclusive hotel contract. The 23-story, 295-room high-rise was completed in 1996 and has been the only place in Tacoma to stay when visiting the casino.

That exclusivity is now in question as new proposals for hotel projects near the EQC are being considered by city officials. The Hilton Garden Inn and Hotel Murano, both just blocks away from the casino, have put forward bids to become the official hotel of the casino with each offering incentives such as free parking and marketing support.

Marriott is fighting back, though, and has made it clear they are not going down without a fight. In a statement to The News Tribune, they made it clear that they view their partnership with EQC as “critical” and expressed displeasure with the idea of another hotel stepping in to take their place:

“It is important to note that our Courtyard Marriott Tacoma Downtown property is full every night and is an important part of our overall business strategy. The proposed development would negatively impact our business, employees and guests.”



The Negotiations between Marriott and EQC are ongoing, but it will be interesting to see how this plays out. With two major companies battling for control over this lucrative market, there is sure to be plenty of fireworks. Stay tuned for updates!

#  How Impervious Is The Courtyard Marriott To Emerald Queen Casino Play Luckyland Slots?

There has been a lot of talk about the new Courtyard Marriott that is being built in Tacoma, Washington. The hotel is being built right next to the Emerald Queen Casino, and many people are wondering how impervious the new hotel will be to casino play.

The short answer is that it is very impervious. The Courtyard Marriott has been designed with anti-casino features that will make it practically impossible for guests to gamble away their hard-earned money.

The first anti-casino feature is the location of the hotel. The Courtyard Marriott is located on the opposite side of the Emerald Queen Casino from where the slot machines are located. This means that guests will have to walk all the way across the casino floor to get to the slots, and by then they will likely have lost interest.

The second anti-casino feature is the design of the hotel itself. The guest rooms are located on the upper floors, which means that guests will not be able to see or hear anything going on in the casino below. This will help keep them from being tempted to gamble.

The third anti-casino feature is the lack of a casino floor inside the hotel. There are no blackjack tables or roulette wheels here; instead, guests can enjoy a nice meal or a drink in one of the two restaurants or three bars located inside the hotel.

So if you're looking for a place to stay in Tacoma, don't worry – the Courtyard Marriott won't let you down!

#  How Closed Off Is The Courtyard Marriott To Emerald Queen Casino Play Luckyland Slots?

Looking for a place to stay in Tacoma while you enjoy all the gaming and entertainment options at Emerald Queen Casino? The Courtyard Marriott is a great option, with comfortable rooms and excellent amenities. But is this hotel too closed off from the casino action?

The Courtyard Marriott is located adjacent to the Emerald Queen Casino, but there is a definite separation between the two properties. While guests of the Marriott can see and hear the casino gaming floor, they cannot directly access it. If you're looking for easy access to all the casino action, you'll need to stay somewhere else.

However, if you're looking for a quiet place to stay where you can catch up on some sleep or work on your laptop, then the Courtyard Marriott is perfect. The rooms are spacious and well-appointed, with comfortable beds and plenty of workspace. Plus, there's an indoor pool and a fitness center on-site, as well as a couple of restaurants. And if you need to run errands or pick up a few things, there's a small convenience store right next door to the hotel.

So if you're looking for easy access to Emerald Queen Casino but don't want to be right in the middle of all the hustle and bustle, then consider staying at the Courtyard Marriott. You'll still be able to enjoy all the great amenities that this hotel has to offer, plus you'll be just minutes away from everything that Emerald Queen Casino has to offer.

You’ve come to the right place! In this article, we will share some tips and tricks that will help you increase your chances of winning big at this casino game. So, read on and get started!</p>
<p>To start with, it’s important to understand how the game works. The Georgie Porgie slot machine is a three-reel game with nine paylines. In order to win, you need to land matching symbols on adjacent reels starting from the leftmost reel. The symbols that you can expect to see on the reels are cherries, bars, 7s, Georgie Porgie, and his dog.</p>
<p>One of the most important things that you need to keep in mind when playing this game is that the payout table changes with every bet. So, always make sure to check the payout table before placing your bet. In general, the higher your bet, the higher your chances of winning will be.</p>
<p>Another thing that you can do to improve your odds is to play max bet. If you are able to afford it, betting max will give you a higher chance of landing winning combinations. Additionally, it will also increase your payout potential if you do happen to win.</p>
<p>Another thing that you can do is use some basic strategy while playing. For example, try not to bet on all nine paylines every time as this will decrease your chances of winning significantly. Instead, try betting on fewer paylines and increasing your bet amount on those lines. This will give you a better chance of winning without risking too much money in the process.</p>
<p>Finally, always remember to keep an eye out for bonus rounds and free spins. These features can often result in big wins so be sure not to miss them when they pop up!</p>

<h1 id="Blackjack"><a href="#Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Blackjack"></a>Blackjack</h1><p>Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games around and it’s easy to see why. It’s simple to learn but offers plenty of opportunities for strategic play. In blackjack, your aim is to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible without going over.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips for winning at blackjack:</p>
<p>• Stick to basic strategy – This is the simplest way to improve your chances of winning at blackjack. Basic strategy takes all of the guesswork out of decision-making and tells you exactly what cards to hold and when to fold. You can find detailed basic strategy charts online or in books such as “Basic Blackjack Strategy: The Smart Way To Play Every Hand” by Michael Dalton.</p>
<p>• Know when to split pairs – If you have two cards of the same rank (e.g Two Queens), you can split them into two separate hands. However, it’s important to remember that if you split Aces, you only get one additional card per Ace.</p>
<p>• Use doubling down wisely – Doubling down is a great way to increase your chances of winning when you have a strong hand (e.g 11). However, use it sparingly – since it effectively doubles your bet, it can be costly if your hand turns out to be weak.</p>
<p>• Manage your bankroll – This is especially important when playing high stakes blackjack games. Make sure you only bet an amount that you can comfortably afford to lose and never chase your losses.</p>
<h1 id="Roulette"><a href="#Roulette" class="headerlink" title="Roulette"></a>Roulette</h1><p>Roulette is another classic casino game that’s simple enough for beginners but offers plenty of opportunity for strategic play. In roulette, players place bets on either a red or black number, or on whether the ball will land on an even or odd number. Here are a few tips for winning at roulette:</p>
<p>• Stick with outside bets – These bets have better odds than inside bets and are less risky overall. For example, instead of betting on a single number, try betting on red or black instead.</p>
<p>  • Make progress payments – Another way to reduce risk when playing roulette is by making progress payments on your bet instead of betting your entire bankroll in one go. For example, if you bet £10 on black and it wins, then bet £20 on black on the next spin etc…</p>
<p>• Use betting systems – There are various betting systems that can help improve your chances of winning at roulette such as the Martingale system or Labouchère system . However, these systems can be complex and should only be used after practicing extensively with demo versions of the game .</p>

Simply guess whether the next card will be black or red, and if you are correct then your winnings will be doubled.
